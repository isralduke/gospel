# Lamentations

## Chapter 1

### א (Alef)

> <a name="25:1:1">1:1</a> Alas!
> The city once full of people
> now sits all alone!
> She who was once prominent among the nations
> has become a widow!
> The princess who once ruled over the provinces
> has become a forced laborer!

### ב (Bet)

> <a name="25:1:2">1:2</a> She weeps bitterly at night;
> tears stream down her cheeks.
> There is no one to comfort her
> among all her former lovers.
> All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
> they have become her enemies.

### ג (Gimel)

> <a name="25:1:3">1:3</a> The people of Judah have gone into exile under affliction
> and under harsh oppression.
> They now live in other nations,
> but find no rest.
> All who pursued them have overtaken them
> in narrow straits.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a name="25:1:4">1:4</a> The roads leading to Zion are in mourning,
> because no one travels down their paths to celebrate the festivals.
> All her city gates are deserted;
> her priests groan in grief.
> Her virgins are filled with sorrow;
> Jerusalem is in bitter anguish!

### ה (He)

> <a name="25:1:5">1:5</a> Her foes subjugated her;
> her enemies plundered her possessions.
> For the Lord afflicted her
> because of her many acts of rebellion.
> Her children were driven away
> as prisoners before the enemy.

### ו (Vav)

> <a name="25:1:6">1:6</a> Everything in which she had gloried
> has been taken away from Zion.
> Her leaders were like deer
> who could not find any hiding place;
> they were too exhausted to flee
> from the hunter.

### ז (Zayin)

> <a name="25:1:7">1:7</a> Jerusalem remembers,
> when she became a poor homeless person,
> all the treasures—possessions that
> belonged to her in days of old.
> When her people fell into the grasp of the enemy,
> none of her allies came to her rescue.
> Her enemies gloat over her;
> they laughed contemptuously at her downfall.

### ח (Khet)

> <a name="25:1:8">1:8</a> Jerusalem has committed heinous sin;
> therefore, she has become an object of scorn.
> All who once respected her now despise her,
> because they have seen her nakedness.
> She herself groans aloud
> and turns away in shame.

### ט (Tet)

> <a name="25:1:9">1:9</a> Her menstrual filth has soiled her own clothing;
> she did not consider the consequences of her sin.
> Her demise occurred in an astonishing way,
> and there was no one to comfort her.
> She cried, “Look, O Lord, on my affliction,
> because my enemy boasts!”

### י (Yod)

> <a name="25:1:10">1:10</a> The enemy seized
> all her valuable possessions.
> She watched in horror as Gentiles invaded her holy temple,
> whom you had forbidden:
> “They may not enter your assembly place.”

### כ (Kaf)

> <a name="25:1:11">1:11</a> All her former inhabitants groan
> as they search for a morsel of bread.
> They are forced to sell their prized possessions
> just to purchase enough food
> to keep themselves alive.
> Jerusalem Speaks:
> Look, O Lord!
> Consider that I have become worthless!

### ל (Lamed)

> <a name="25:1:12">1:12</a> O you who pass by on the road,
> is it nothing to you?
> Consider and see:
> Is there any pain like my pain?
> The Lord brought it on me;
> he inflicted it on me when he burned with anger.

### מ (Mem)

> <a name="25:1:13">1:13</a> He sent down fierce fire into my bones,
> and it prevailed against them.
> He stretched a trapper’s net to ensnare my feet;
> he made me turn back.
> He made me desolate,
> sick all day long.

### נ (Nun)

> <a name="25:1:14">1:14</a> My sins are bound around my neck like a yoke,
> they are lashed tight together by his hand.
> He has placed his yoke on my neck;
> he has made me weak.
> The Lord has handed me over
> to those whom I am powerless to resist.

### ס (Samek)

> <a name="25:1:15">1:15</a> The Lord has hurled all my valiant warriors
> out of my midst.
> He summoned a legal assembly against me
> to crush my young warriors.
> As in a wine press, the Lord has trampled down
> the virgin daughter of Judah.

### ע (Ayin)

> <a name="25:1:16">1:16</a> I weep on account of these things;
> my eyes flow with tears.
> For there is no one to comfort me anywhere near,
> no one who could encourage me.
> My inhabitants are desolated
> because the enemy has prevailed.
> The Prophet Speaks:

### פ (Pe)

> <a name="25:1:17">1:17</a> Zion spread out her hands,
> but there is no one to comfort her.
> The Lord has issued a decree against Jacob:
> The nations that surround him will become his enemies.

> like filthy garbage in their midst.

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### צ (Tsade)

> <a name="25:1:18">1:18</a> The Lord is right to judge me!
> For I rebelled against his commands.
> Listen, all you peoples,
> and behold my suffering!
> My young men and women
> have been taken prisoner into exile.

### ק (Qof)

> <a name="25:1:19">1:19</a> I called for my lovers,

> while searching for food that might have kept them alive.

### ר (Resh)

> <a name="25:1:20">1:20</a> Look, O Lord, because I am in distress,
> my stomach is in knots!
> My heart is turning over inside me,
> because I know how terribly rebellious I had been!
> In the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children;
> the rest die of hunger inside their homes.

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a name="25:1:21">1:21</a> They have heard that I groan,
> yet there is no one to comfort me.
> All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
> they are glad that you have brought it about.
> May you bring about the time of judgment that you promised,
> so that they may be judged like me!

### ת (Tav)

> <a name="25:1:22">1:22</a> Let all their wickedness come before you;
> may you deal with them
> just as you have dealt with me,
> because of all my acts of rebellion.
> For my groans are many,
> and my heart is full of sorrow.
> The Prophet Speaks:

## Chapter 2

### א (Alef)

> <a name="25:2:1">2:1</a> Alas!
> The Lord has covered Zion

### ד (Dalet)

> <a name="25:2:4">2:4</a> Like an enemy he strung his archer’s bow;
> his right hand was ready to shoot.
> Like a foe he has slain
> all our vigorous young men;
> he has poured out his wrath like fire
> on the tents of Zion.

### ה (He)

> <a name="25:2:5">2:5</a> The Lord was like an enemy;

> He made everyone in Judah

### ז (Zayin)

> <a name="25:2:7">2:7</a> The Lord has rejected his altar

### ח (Khet)

> <a name="25:2:8">2:8</a> The Lord was determined to tear down

### ל (Lamed)

### מ (Mem)

> <a name="25:2:13">2:13</a> With what can I equate you?

### נ (Nun)

> <a name="25:2:14">2:14</a> The visions that your prophets proclaimed to you

### ס (Samek)

> <a name="25:2:15">2:15</a> All who pass by you on the road

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### ר (Resh)

> <a name="25:2:20">2:20</a> O Lord, think about it!

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a name="25:2:21">2:21</a> The young and old lie dead together

> The perfectly healthy children whom I bore and raised,
> my enemy has destroyed.
> The Prophet Speaks:

> he shuts his ears to my prayer.
> <a name="25:3:9">3:9</a> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of fitted stones;

### ד (Dalet)

> <a name="25:3:10">3:10</a> He is like a bear lying in wait for me,

### ז (Zayin)

> <a name="25:3:19">3:19</a> Just thinking about my impoverished and homeless condition

### כ (Kaf)

### ל (Lamed)

> <a name="25:3:34">3:34</a> To crush underfoot

### The People of Jerusalem Pray:

> <a name="25:5:1">5:1</a> O Lord, consider what has happened to us;
> please pay attention and take notice of the disgrace we are suffering.
> <a name="25:5:2">5:2</a> Strangers have taken possession of the land that we inherited,
> foreigners now occupy our homes.
> <a name="25:5:3">5:3</a> We have become orphans and fatherless,
> our mothers have become widows.
> <a name="25:5:4">5:4</a> We must pay money to drink our own water;
> we must buy our own wood at a steep price.
> <a name="25:5:5">5:5</a> We are pursued—our adversaries are breathing down our necks;
> we are physically worn out and cannot find any rest.
> <a name="25:5:6">5:6</a> We have made treaties with Egypt and Assyria
> just to acquire enough food to keep us alive.
> <a name="25:5:7">5:7</a> Our ancestors sinned and are now dead,
> so we are left to bear their punishment.
> <a name="25:5:8">5:8</a> Tyrants rule over us;
> there is no one to rescue us from their control.
> <a name="25:5:9">5:9</a> We risk our lives when we search for food
> because murderous marauders lurk in the countryside.
> <a name="25:5:10">5:10</a> Our skin is hot as an oven;
> we are feverish from hunger.
> <a name="25:5:11">5:11</a> Our wives have been raped in the City of Zion;
> our virgin daughters have been ravished in the towns of Judah.
> <a name="25:5:12">5:12</a> They executed the royal family by hanging;
> they have mistreated our elders.
> <a name="25:5:13">5:13</a> They force our young men to perform menial physical labor;
> they make our boys carry heavy loads of wood.
> <a name="25:5:14">5:14</a> The elders no longer conduct business at the city gate;
> the young men have stopped playing their joyful music.
> <a name="25:5:15">5:15</a> Our hearts no longer experience any joy;
> instead of dancing with joy, we mourn and lament.
> <a name="25:5:16">5:16</a> The crown has fallen from our head;
> woe to us, for we have sinned!
> <a name="25:5:17">5:17</a> Because of this, we are very sorrowful;

> <a name="25:5:18">5:18</a> For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,
> which lies deserted.
> <a name="25:5:19">5:19</a> But you, O Lord, reign forever;
> your throne endures from generation to generation.
> <a name="25:5:20">5:20</a> Why have you forgotten us forever?
> Why do you forsake us so long?
> <a name="25:5:21">5:21</a> Bring us back to yourself, O Lord, and let us return to you;
> renew our life as in ancient times.
> <a name="25:5:22">5:22</a> Or are you determined to reject us once and for all?
> Are you angry with us beyond limit?
