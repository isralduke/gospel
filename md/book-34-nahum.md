### God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies

> <a name="34:1:2">1:2</a> The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;
> the Lord is avenging and very angry.
> The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;
> he sustains his rage against his enemies.
> <a name="34:1:3">1:3</a> The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;
> the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.

### The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People

> He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm;
> dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
> <a name="34:1:4">1:4</a> He shouts a battle cry against the seaand makes it dry up;
> he makes all the rivers run dry.
> Bashan and Carmel wither;
> the blossom of Lebanon withers.
> <a name="34:1:5">1:5</a> The mountains tremble before him,
> the hills convulse;
> the earth is laid waste before him,
> the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
> <a name="34:1:6">1:6</a> No one can withstand his indignation!
> No one can resist his fierce anger!
> His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,
> boulders are broken up as he approaches.
> <a name="34:1:7">1:7</a> The Lord is good—
> indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress,
> and he protects those who seek refuge in him.
> <a name="34:1:8">1:8</a> But with an overwhelming flood
> he will make a complete end of Nineveh;
> he will drive his enemies into darkness.

### Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh

> <a name="34:1:9">1:9</a> Whatever you plot against the Lord, he will completely destroy!
> Distress will not arise a second time.
> <a name="34:1:10">1:10</a> Surely they will be totally consumed
> like entangled thorn bushes,
> like the drink of drunkards,
> like very dry stubble.
> <a name="34:1:11">1:11</a> From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the Lord,
> a wicked military strategist.

### Oracle of Deliverance to Judah

> <a name="34:1:12">1:12</a> This is what the Lord says:
> “Even though they are powerful—
> and what’s more, even though their army is numerous—
> nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!
> Although I afflicted you,
> I will afflict you no more.
> <a name="34:1:13">1:13</a> And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;
> I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
> Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh
> <a name="34:1:14">1:14</a> The Lord has issued a decree against you:
> “Your dynasty will come to an end.
> I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.
> I will desecrate your grave—because you are accursed!”

### Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah

> <a name="34:1:15">1:15</a> Look! A herald is running on the mountains!
> A messenger is proclaiming deliverance:
> “Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!
> Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God!
> For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you,
> they have been completely destroyed.”
> Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh

### “Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh”

> <a name="34:2:1">2:1</a> The watchmen of Nineveh shout:
> “An enemy who will scatter you is marching out to attack you!”
> “Guard the rampart!
> Watch the road!
> Prepare yourselves for battle!
> Muster your mighty strength!”
> <a name="34:2:2">2:2</a> For the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob,
> as well as the majesty of Israel,
> though their enemies have plundered them
> and have destroyed their fields.

### Prophetic Vision of the Fall of Nineveh

> <a name="34:2:3">2:3</a> The shields of his warriors are dyed red;
> the mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments.
> The metal fittings of the chariots shine like fire on the day of battle;
> the soldiers brandish their spears.
> <a name="34:2:4">2:4</a> The chariots race madly through the streets,
> they rush back and forth in the broad plazas;
> they look like lightning bolts,
> they dash here and there like flashes of lightning.
> <a name="34:2:5">2:5</a> The commander orders his officers;
> they stumble as they advance;
> they rush to the city wall
> and they set up the covered siege tower.
> <a name="34:2:6">2:6</a> The sluice gates are opened;
> the royal palace is deluged and dissolves.
> <a name="34:2:7">2:7</a> Nineveh is taken into exile and is led away;
> her slave girls moan like doves while they beat their breasts.
> <a name="34:2:8">2:8</a> Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,
> but now her people are running away;
> she cries out: “Stop! Stop!”—
> but no one turns back.
> <a name="34:2:9">2:9</a> Her conquerors cry out:
> “Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”
> There is no end to the treasure;
> riches of every kind of precious thing.
> <a name="34:2:10">2:10</a> Destruction, devastation, and desolation!
> Their hearts faint,
> their knees tremble,
> each stomach churns, each face turns pale!

### Taunt against the Once-Mighty Lion

> <a name="34:2:11">2:11</a> Where now is the den of the lions,
> the feeding place of the young lions,
> where the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled
> and no one disturbed them?
> <a name="34:2:12">2:12</a> The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs needed
> and strangled prey to provide food for his lionesses;
> he filled his lairs with prey
> and his dens with torn flesh.

### Battle Cry of the Divine Warrior

> <a name="34:2:13">2:13</a> “I am against you!” declares the Lord who leads armies:
> “I will burn your chariots with fire;
> the sword will devour your young lions;
> you will no longer prey upon the land;
> the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”

## Chapter 3

### Reason for Judgment: Sins of Nineveh

> <a name="34:3:1">3:1</a> Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed!
> She is full of lies;
> she is filled with plunder;
> she has hoarded her spoil!

### Portrayal of the Destruction of Nineveh

> <a name="34:3:2">3:2</a> The chariot drivers will crack their whips;
> the chariot wheels will shake the ground;
> the chariot horses will gallop;
> the war chariots will bolt forward!
> <a name="34:3:3">3:3</a> The charioteers will charge ahead;
> their swords will flash
> and their spears will glimmer!
> There will be many people slain;
> there will be piles of the dead,
> and countless casualties—
> so many that people will stumble over the corpses.

### Taunt against the Harlot City

> <a name="34:3:4">3:4</a> “Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute—
> a seductive mistress who practices sorcery,
> who enslaves nations by her harlotry,
> and entices peoples by her sorcery—
> <a name="34:3:5">3:5</a> I am against you,” declares the Lord who leads armies.
> “I will strip off your clothes!
> I will show your nakedness to the nations
> and your shame to the kingdoms;
> <a name="34:3:6">3:6</a> I will pelt you with filth;
> I will treat you with contempt;
> I will make you a public spectacle.
> <a name="34:3:7">3:7</a> Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust;
> they will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated!
> Who will lament for her?’
> There will be no one to comfort you!”

### Nineveh Will Suffer the Same Fate as Thebes

> <a name="34:3:8">3:8</a> You are no more secure than Thebes—
> she was located on the banks of the Nile;
> the waters surrounded her,
> herrampart was the sea,
> the water was her wall.
> <a name="34:3:9">3:9</a> Cush and Egypt had limitless strength;
> Put and the Libyans were among her allies.
> <a name="34:3:10">3:10</a> Yet she went into captivity as an exile;
> even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.
> They cast lots for her nobility;
> all her dignitaries were bound with chains.
> <a name="34:3:11">3:11</a> You too will act like drunkards;
> you will go into hiding;
> you too will seek refuge from the enemy.

### The Assyrian Defenses Will Fail

> <a name="34:3:12">3:12</a> All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit:
> If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater!
> <a name="34:3:13">3:13</a> Your warriors will be like women in your midst;
> the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies;
> fire will consume the bars of your gates.
> <a name="34:3:14">3:14</a> Draw yourselves water for a siege!
> Strengthen your fortifications!
> Trample the mud and tread the clay!
> Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!
> <a name="34:3:15">3:15</a> There the fire will consume you;
> the sword will cut you down;
> it will devour you like the young locust would.

### The Assyrian Defenders Will Flee

> Multiply yourself like the young locust;
> multiply yourself like the flying locust!
> <a name="34:3:16">3:16</a> Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven!
> They are like the young locust which sheds its skin and flies away.
> <a name="34:3:17">3:17</a> Your courtiers are like locusts,
> your officials are like a swarm of locusts!
> They encamp in the walls on a cold day,
> yet when the sun rises, they fly away;
> and no one knows where they are.

### Concluding Dirge

> <a name="34:3:18">3:18</a> Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria!
> Your officers are slumbering!
> Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains
> and there is no one to regather them!
> <a name="34:3:19">3:19</a> Your destruction is like an incurable wound;
> your demise is like a fatal injury!
> All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy,
> for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!
