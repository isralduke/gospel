Indeed some Hamites had been living there prior to that. <a name="13:4:41">4:41</a> The men whose names are listed came during the time of King Hezekiah of Judah and attacked the Hamites’ settlements, as well as the Meunites they discovered there, and they wiped them out to this very day.

### Reuben’s Descendants

<a name="13:5:1">5:1</a> The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn—

(Now he was the firstborn, but when he defiled his father’s bed, his rights as firstborn were given to the sons of Joseph, Israel’s son. So Reuben is not listed as firstborn in the genealogical records. <a name="13:5:2">5:2</a> Though Judah was the strongest among his brothers and a leader descended from him, the right of the firstborn belonged to Joseph.)

<a name="13:5:3">5:3</a> The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn:

Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi.

<a name="13:5:4">5:4</a> The descendants of Joel:

His son Shemaiah, his son Gog, his son Shimei, <a name="13:5:5">5:5</a> his son Micah, his son Reaiah, his son Baal, <a name="13:5:6">5:6</a> and his son Beerah, whom King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria carried into exile. Beerah was the tribal leader of Reuben.

<a name="13:5:7">5:7</a> His brothers by their clans, as listed in their genealogical records:

The leader Jeiel, Zechariah, <a name="13:5:8">5:8</a> and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel.

They lived in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal Meon. <a name="13:5:9">5:9</a> In the east they settled as far as the entrance to the desert that stretches to the Euphrates River, for their cattle had increased in numbers in the land of Gilead. <a name="13:5:10">5:10</a> During the time of Saul they attacked the Hagrites and defeated them. They took over their territory in the entire eastern region of Gilead.

### Gad’s Descendants

<a name="13:5:11">5:11</a> The descendants of Gad lived near them in the land of Bashan, as far as Salecah.

<a name="13:5:12">5:12</a> They included Joel the leader, Shapham the second in command, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan. <a name="13:5:13">5:13</a> Their relatives, listed according to their families, included Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jakan, Zia, and Eber—seven in all.

<a name="13:5:14">5:14</a> These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jeshishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz. <a name="13:5:15">5:15</a> Ahi son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was the leader of the family. <a name="13:5:16">5:16</a> They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its surrounding settlements, and in the pasturelands of Sharon to their very borders. <a name="13:5:17">5:17</a> All of them were listed in the genealogical records in the time of King Jotham of Judah and in the time of King Jeroboam of Israel.

<a name="13:5:18">5:18</a> The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 men in their combined armies, warriors who carried shields and swords, were equipped with bows, and were trained for war. <a name="13:5:19">5:19</a> They attacked the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. <a name="13:5:20">5:20</a> They received divine help in fighting them, and the Hagrites and all their allies were handed over to them. They cried out to God during the battle; he responded to their prayers because they trusted in him. <a name="13:5:21">5:21</a> They seized the Hagrites’ animals, including fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys. They also took captive one hundred thousand people. <a name="13:5:22">5:22</a> Because God fought for them, they killed many of the enemy. They dispossessed the Hagrites and lived in their land until the exile.

### The Half-Tribe of Manasseh

<a name="13:5:23">5:23</a> The half-tribe of Manasseh settled in the land from Bashan as far as Baal Hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. They grew in number.

<a name="13:5:24">5:24</a> These were the leaders of their families:

Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were skilled warriors, men of reputation, and leaders of their families. <a name="13:5:25">5:25</a> But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and worshiped the gods of the native peoples whom God had destroyed before them. <a name="13:5:26">5:26</a> So the God of Israel stirred up King Pul of Assyria (that is, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria), and he carried away the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh and took them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this very day.

## Chapter 9

<a name="13:9:1">9:1</a> Genealogical records were kept for all Israel; they are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel.

### Exiles Who Resettled in Jerusalem

The people of Judah were carried away to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness. <a name="13:9:2">9:2</a> The first to resettle on their property and in their cities were some Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants. <a name="13:9:3">9:3</a> Some from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim and Manasseh settled in Jerusalem.

<a name="13:9:4">9:4</a> The settlers included: Uthai son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, who was a descendant of Perez son of Judah.

<a name="13:9:5">9:5</a> From the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.

<a name="13:9:6">9:6</a> From the descendants of Zerah: Jeuel.

<a name="13:9:9">9:9</a> Their relatives, listed in their genealogical records, numbered 956. All these men were leaders of their families.

<a name="13:9:13">9:13</a> Their relatives, who were leaders of their families, numbered 1,760. They were capable men who were assigned to carry out the various tasks of service in God’s temple.

<a name="13:9:14">9:14</a> From the Levites:

Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah a descendant of Merari; <a name="13:9:15">9:15</a> Bakbakkar; Heresh; Galal; Mattaniah son of Mika, son of Zikri, son of Asaph; <a name="13:9:16">9:16</a> Obadiah son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah son of Asa, son of Elkanah, who lived among the settlements of the Netophathites.

<a name="13:9:17">9:17</a> The gatekeepers were:

Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers. Shallum was the leader; <a name="13:9:18">9:18</a> he serves to this day at the King’s Gate on the east. These were the gatekeepers from the camp of the descendants of Levi.

<a name="13:9:19">9:19</a> Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his relatives from his family (the Korahites) were assigned to guard the entrance to the sanctuary. Their ancestors had guarded the entrance to the Lord’s dwelling place. <a name="13:9:20">9:20</a> Phinehas son of Eleazar had been their leader in earlier times, and the Lord was with him. <a name="13:9:21">9:21</a> Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the guard at the entrance to the meeting tent.

<a name="13:9:22">9:22</a> All those selected to be gatekeepers at the entrances numbered 212. Their names were recorded in the genealogical records of their settlements. David and Samuel the prophet had appointed them to their positions. <a name="13:9:23">9:23</a> They and their descendants were assigned to guard the gates of the Lord’s sanctuary (that is, the tabernacle). <a name="13:9:24">9:24</a> The gatekeepers were posted on all four sides—east, west, north, and south. <a name="13:9:25">9:25</a> Their relatives, who lived in their settlements, came from time to time and served with them for seven-day periods. <a name="13:9:26">9:26</a> The four head gatekeepers, who were Levites, were assigned to guard the storerooms and treasuries in God’s sanctuary. <a name="13:9:27">9:27</a> They would spend the night in their posts all around God’s sanctuary, for they were assigned to guard it and would open it with the key every morning. <a name="13:9:28">9:28</a> Some of them were in charge of the articles used by those who served; they counted them when they brought them in and when they brought them out. <a name="13:9:29">9:29</a> Some of them were in charge of the equipment and articles of the sanctuary, as well as the flour, wine, olive oil, incense, and spices. <a name="13:9:30">9:30</a> Some of the priests mixed the spices. <a name="13:9:31">9:31</a> Mattithiah, a Levite, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of baking the bread for offerings. <a name="13:9:32">9:32</a> Some of the Kohathites, their relatives, were in charge of preparing the bread that is displayed each Sabbath.

<a name="13:9:33">9:33</a> The musicians and Levite family leaders stayed in rooms at the sanctuary and were exempt from other duties, for day and night they had to carry out their assigned tasks. <a name="13:9:34">9:34</a> These were the family leaders of the Levites, as listed in their genealogical records. They lived in Jerusalem.

### Jeiel’s Descendants

<a name="13:9:35">9:35</a> Jeiel (the father of Gibeon) lived in Gibeon. His wife was Maacah. <a name="13:9:36">9:36</a> His firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, <a name="13:9:37">9:37</a> Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. <a name="13:9:38">9:38</a> Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They also lived near their relatives in Jerusalem.

<a name="13:9:39">9:39</a> Ner was the father of Kish, and Kish was the father of Saul. Saul was the father of Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

<a name="13:9:40">9:40</a> The son of Jonathan:

Meribbaal, who was the father of Micah.

<a name="13:9:41">9:41</a> The sons of Micah:

Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.

<a name="13:9:42">9:42</a> Achaz was the father of Jarah, and Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri was the father of Moza, <a name="13:9:43">9:43</a> and Moza was the father of Binea. His son was Rephaiah, whose son was Eleasah, whose son was Azel.

## Chapter 10

### Saul’s Death

<a name="13:10:1">10:1</a> The Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. <a name="13:10:2">10:2</a> The Philistines stayed right on the heels of Saul and his sons; they struck down Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua. <a name="13:10:3">10:3</a> The battle was thick around Saul; the archers overtook him and wounded him. <a name="13:10:4">10:4</a> Saul told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and stab me with it, so these uncircumcised people won’t be able to torture me.” But the armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. <a name="13:10:5">10:5</a> When the armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. <a name="13:10:6">10:6</a> So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household died together. <a name="13:10:7">10:7</a> When all the Israelites who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them.

<a name="13:10:8">10:8</a> The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa. <a name="13:10:9">10:9</a> They stripped his corpse, and then carried off his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the news to their idols and their people. <a name="13:10:10">10:10</a> They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon. <a name="13:10:11">10:11</a> When all the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard about all that the Philistines had done to Saul, <a name="13:10:12">10:12</a> all the warriors went and recovered the corpses of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their remains under the oak tree in Jabesh and fasted for seven days.

<a name="13:10:13">10:13</a> So Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord and did not obey the Lord’s instructions; he even tried to conjure up underworld spirits. <a name="13:10:14">10:14</a> He did not seek the Lord’s guidance; so the Lord killed him and transferred the kingdom to David son of Jesse.

## Chapter 11

### David Becomes King

<a name="13:11:1">11:1</a> All Israel joined David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood! <a name="13:11:2">11:2</a> In the past, even when Saul was king, you were Israel’s general. The Lord your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over my people Israel.’” <a name="13:11:3">11:3</a> When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord, and they designated him king over Israel, just as the Lord had announced through Samuel.

### David Conquers Jerusalem

<a name="13:11:4">11:4</a> David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). (The Jebusites, the land’s original inhabitants, lived there.) <a name="13:11:5">11:5</a> The residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot invade this place!” But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David). <a name="13:11:6">11:6</a> David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become general!” So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first and became commander. <a name="13:11:7">11:7</a> David lived in the fortress; for this reason it is called the City of David. <a name="13:11:8">11:8</a> He built up the city around it, from the terrace to the surrounding walls; Joab restored the rest of the city. <a name="13:11:9">11:9</a> David’s power steadily grew, for the Lord who leads armies was with him.

### David’s Warriors

<a name="13:11:10">11:10</a> These were the leaders of David’s warriors who helped establish and stabilize his rule over all Israel, in accordance with the Lord’s word. <a name="13:11:11">11:11</a> This is the list of David’s warriors:

Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was head of the officers. He killed three hundred men with his spear in a single battle.

<a name="13:11:12">11:12</a> Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of the three elite warriors. <a name="13:11:13">11:13</a> He was with David in Pas Dammim when the Philistines assembled there for battle. In an area of the field that was full of barley, the army retreated before the Philistines, <a name="13:11:14">11:14</a> but then they made a stand in the middle of that area. They defended it and defeated the Philistines; the Lord gave them a great victory.

<a name="13:11:15">11:15</a> Three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the rocky cliff at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine force was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. <a name="13:11:16">11:16</a> David was in the stronghold, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. <a name="13:11:17">11:17</a> David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!” <a name="13:11:18">11:18</a> So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate. They carried it back to David, but David refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord <a name="13:11:19">11:19</a> and said, “God forbid that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it to him, he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.

<a name="13:11:20">11:20</a> Abishai the brother of Joab was head of the three elite warriors. He killed three hundred men with his spear and gained fame along with the three elite warriors. <a name="13:11:21">11:21</a> From the three he was given double honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of them.

<a name="13:11:22">11:22</a> Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab; he also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a cistern on a snowy day. <a name="13:11:23">11:23</a> He even killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom; Benaiah attacked him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. <a name="13:11:24">11:24</a> Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who gained fame along with the three elite warriors. <a name="13:11:25">11:25</a> He received honor from the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

<a name="13:11:26">11:26</a> The mighty warriors were:

## Chapter 12

### Warriors Who Joined David at Ziklag

<a name="13:12:1">12:1</a> These were the men who joined David in Ziklag, when he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (They were among the warriors who assisted him in battle. <a name="13:12:2">12:2</a> They were armed with bows and could shoot arrows or sling stones right or left-handed. They were fellow tribesmen of Saul from Benjamin):

<a name="13:12:3">12:3</a> Ahiezer, the leader, and Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth;

Berachah,

Jehu the Anathothite,

<a name="13:12:4">12:4</a> Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, one of the thirty warriors and their leader,

Jeremiah,

Jahaziel,

Johanan,

Jozabad the Gederathite,

<a name="13:12:5">12:5</a> Eluzai,

Jerimoth,

Bealiah,

Shemariah,

Shephatiah the Haruphite,

<a name="13:12:6">12:6</a> Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites,

<a name="13:12:7">12:7</a> and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.

<a name="13:12:8">12:8</a> Some of the Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the desert. They were warriors who were trained for battle; they carried shields and spears. They were as fierce as lions and could run as quickly as gazelles across the hills. <a name="13:12:9">12:9</a> Ezer was the leader, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third, <a name="13:12:10">12:10</a> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, <a name="13:12:11">12:11</a> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, <a name="13:12:12">12:12</a> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, <a name="13:12:13">12:13</a> Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. <a name="13:12:14">12:14</a> These Gadites were military leaders; the least led a hundred men, the greatest a thousand. <a name="13:12:15">12:15</a> They crossed the Jordan River in the first month, when it was overflowing its banks, and routed those living in all the valleys to the east and west.

<a name="13:12:16">12:16</a> Some from Benjamin and Judah also came to David’s stronghold. <a name="13:12:17">12:17</a> David went out to meet them and said, “If you come to me in peace and want to help me, then I will make an alliance with you. But if you come to betray me to my enemies when I have not harmed you, may the God of our ancestors take notice and judge!” <a name="13:12:18">12:18</a> But a spirit empowered Amasai, the leader of the thirty warriors, and he said:

> “We are yours, O David!
> We support you, O son of Jesse!
> May you greatly prosper!
> May those who help you prosper!
> Indeed your God helps you!”

So David accepted them and made them leaders of raiding bands.

<a name="13:12:19">12:19</a> Some men from Manasseh joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (But in the end they did not help the Philistines because, after taking counsel, the Philistine lords sent David away, saying: “It would be disastrous for us if he deserts to his master Saul.”) <a name="13:12:20">12:20</a> When David went to Ziklag, the men of Manasseh who joined him were Adnach, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of a thousand soldiers each in the tribe of Manasseh. <a name="13:12:21">12:21</a> They helped David fight against raiding bands, for all of them were warriors and leaders in the army. <a name="13:12:22">12:22</a> Each day men came to help David until his army became very large.

### Support for David in Hebron

<a name="13:12:23">12:23</a> The following is a record of the armed warriors who came with their leaders and joined David in Hebron in order to make David king in Saul’s place, in accordance with the Lord’s decree:

<a name="13:12:24">12:24</a> From Judah came 6,800 trained warriors carrying shields and spears.

<a name="13:12:25">12:25</a> From Simeon there were 7,100 warriors.

<a name="13:12:26">12:26</a> From Levi there were 4,600. <a name="13:12:27">12:27</a> Jehoiada, the leader of Aaron’s descendants, brought 3,700 men with him, <a name="13:12:28">12:28</a> along with Zadok, a young warrior, and twenty-two leaders from his family.

<a name="13:12:29">12:29</a> From Benjamin, Saul’s tribe, there were 3,000, most of whom, up to that time, had been loyal to Saul.

<a name="13:12:30">12:30</a> From Ephraim there were 20,800 warriors, who had brought fame to their families.

<a name="13:12:31">12:31</a> From the half tribe of Manasseh there were 18,000 who had been designated by name to come and make David king.

<a name="13:12:32">12:32</a> From Issachar there were 200 leaders and all their relatives at their command—they understood the times and knew what Israel should do.

<a name="13:12:33">12:33</a> From Zebulun there were 50,000 warriors who were prepared for battle, equipped with all kinds of weapons, and ready to give their undivided loyalty.

<a name="13:12:34">12:34</a> From Naphtali there were 1,000 officers, along with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears.

<a name="13:12:35">12:35</a> From Dan there were 28,600 men prepared for battle.

<a name="13:12:36">12:36</a> From Asher there were 40,000 warriors prepared for battle.

<a name="13:12:37">12:37</a> From the other side of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 men armed with all kinds of weapons.

<a name="13:12:38">12:38</a> All these men were warriors who were ready to march. They came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel by acclamation; all the rest of the Israelites also were in agreement that David should become king. <a name="13:12:39">12:39</a> They spent three days feasting there with David, for their relatives had given them provisions. <a name="13:12:40">12:40</a> Also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There were large supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, beef, and lamb, for Israel was celebrating.

## Chapter 13

### Uzzah Meets Disaster

<a name="13:13:1">13:1</a> David consulted with his military officers, including those who led groups of a thousand and those who led groups of a hundred. <a name="13:13:2">13:2</a> David said to the whole Israelite assembly, “If you so desire and the Lord our God approves, let’s spread the word to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites in their cities, so they may join us. <a name="13:13:3">13:3</a> Let’s move the ark of our God back here, for we did not seek his will throughout Saul’s reign.” <a name="13:13:4">13:4</a> The whole assembly agreed to do this, for the proposal seemed right to all the people. <a name="13:13:5">13:5</a> So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. <a name="13:13:6">13:6</a> David and all Israel went up to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, who sits enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by his name.

<a name="13:13:7">13:7</a> They transported the ark on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart, <a name="13:13:8">13:8</a> while David and all Israel were energetically celebrating before God, singing and playing various stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. <a name="13:13:9">13:9</a> When they arrived at the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to grab hold of the ark, because the oxen stumbled. <a name="13:13:10">13:10</a> The Lord was so furious with Uzzah, he killed him, because he reached out his hand and touched the ark. He died right there before God.

<a name="13:13:11">13:11</a> David was angry because the Lord attacked Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah, which remains its name to this very day. <a name="13:13:12">13:12</a> David was afraid of God that day and said, “How will I ever be able to bring the ark of God up here?” <a name="13:13:13">13:13</a> So David did not move the ark to the City of David; he left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <a name="13:13:14">13:14</a> The ark of God remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months; the Lord blessed Obed-Edom’s family and all that belonged to him.

## Chapter 14

### David’s Prestige Grows

<a name="13:14:1">14:1</a> King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters to build a palace for him. <a name="13:14:2">14:2</a> David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had become prominent for the sake of his people Israel.

<a name="13:14:3">14:3</a> In Jerusalem David married more wives and fathered more sons and daughters. <a name="13:14:4">14:4</a> These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <a name="13:14:5">14:5</a> Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, <a name="13:14:6">14:6</a> Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, <a name="13:14:7">14:7</a> Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

<a name="13:14:8">14:8</a> When the Philistines heard that David had been designated king of all Israel, all the Philistines marched up to confront him. When David heard about it, he marched out against them. <a name="13:14:9">14:9</a> Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim. <a name="13:14:10">14:10</a> David asked God, “Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The Lord said to him, “March up! I will hand them over to you!” <a name="13:14:11">14:11</a> So they marched against Baal Perazim and David defeated them there. David said, “Using me as his instrument, God has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out.” So that place is called Baal Perazim. <a name="13:14:12">14:12</a> The Philistines abandoned their idols there, so David ordered that they be burned.

<a name="13:14:13">14:13</a> The Philistines again raided the valley. <a name="13:14:14">14:14</a> So David again asked God what he should do. God told him, “Don’t march up behind them; circle around them and meet them in front of the trees. <a name="13:14:15">14:15</a> When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, then attack. For God marches out before you to strike down the Philistine army.” <a name="13:14:16">14:16</a> David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.

<a name="13:14:17">14:17</a> So David became famous in all the lands; the Lord caused all the nations to fear him.

## Chapter 15

### David Brings the Ark to Jerusalem

<a name="13:15:1">15:1</a> David constructed buildings in the City of David; he then selected a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. <a name="13:15:2">15:2</a> Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to serve before him perpetually. <a name="13:15:3">15:3</a> David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the Lord up to the place he had prepared for it. <a name="13:15:4">15:4</a> David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:

<a name="13:15:5">15:5</a> From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:6">15:6</a> From the descendants of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:7">15:7</a> From the descendants of Gershom: Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:8">15:8</a> From the descendants of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:9">15:9</a> From the descendants of Hebron: Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:10">15:10</a> From the descendants of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.

<a name="13:15:11">15:11</a> David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. <a name="13:15:12">15:12</a> He told them: “You are the leaders of the Levites’ families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel up to the place I have prepared for it. <a name="13:15:13">15:13</a> The first time you did not carry it; that is why the Lord God attacked us, because we sure did not ask him about the proper way to carry it.” <a name="13:15:14">15:14</a> The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel. <a name="13:15:15">15:15</a> The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had ordered according to the divine command.

<a name="13:15:16">15:16</a> David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully. <a name="13:15:17">15:17</a> So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; one of the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah; <a name="13:15:18">15:18</a> along with some of their relatives who were second in rank, including Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.

<a name="13:15:19">15:19</a> The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; <a name="13:15:20">15:20</a> Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to the alamoth style; <a name="13:15:21">15:21</a> Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play the lyres according to the sheminith style, as led by the director; <a name="13:15:22">15:22</a> Kenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was in charge of transport, for he was well-informed on this matter; <a name="13:15:23">15:23</a> Berechiah and Elkanah were guardians of the ark; <a name="13:15:24">15:24</a> Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; Obed-Edom and Jehiel were also guardians of the ark.

<a name="13:15:25">15:25</a> So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from the house of Obed-Edom with celebration. <a name="13:15:26">15:26</a> When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the Lord’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. <a name="13:15:27">15:27</a> David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians; David also wore a linen ephod. <a name="13:15:28">15:28</a> All Israel brought up the ark of the Lord’s covenant; they were shouting, blowing trumpets, sounding cymbals, and playing stringed instruments. <a name="13:15:29">15:29</a> As the ark of the Lord’s covenant entered the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window. When she saw King David jumping and celebrating, she despised him.

## Chapter 16

### David Leads in Worship

<a name="13:16:1">16:1</a> They brought the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace before God. <a name="13:16:2">16:2</a> When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the Lord’s name. <a name="13:16:3">16:3</a> He then handed out to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. <a name="13:16:4">16:4</a> He appointed some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the Lord, to offer prayers, songs of thanks, and hymns to the Lord God of Israel. <a name="13:16:5">16:5</a> Asaph was the leader, Zechariah second in command, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play stringed instruments; Asaph was to sound the cymbals; <a name="13:16:6">16:6</a> and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of God’s covenant.

### David Thanks God

<a name="13:16:7">16:7</a> That day David first gave to Asaph and his colleagues this song of thanks to the Lord:

> <a name="13:16:8">16:8</a> Give thanks to the Lord!
> Call on his name!
> Make known his accomplishments among the nations!
> <a name="13:16:9">16:9</a> Sing to him! Make music to him!
> Reflect on all his miraculous deeds!
> <a name="13:16:10">16:10</a> Boast about his holy name!
> Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!
> <a name="13:16:11">16:11</a> Seek the Lord and the strength he gives!
> Seek his presence continually!
> <a name="13:16:12">16:12</a> Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,
> his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,
> <a name="13:16:13">16:13</a> O children of Israel, God’s servant,
> you descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones!
> <a name="13:16:14">16:14</a> He is the Lord our God;
> he carries out judgment throughout the earth.
> <a name="13:16:15">16:15</a> Remember continually his covenantal decree,
> the promise he made to a thousand generations—
> <a name="13:16:16">16:16</a> the promise he made to Abraham,
> the promise he made by oath to Isaac!
> <a name="13:16:17">16:17</a> He gave it to Jacob as a decree,
> to Israel as a lasting promise,
> <a name="13:16:18">16:18</a> saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
> as the portion of your inheritance.”
> <a name="13:16:19">16:19</a> When they were few in number,
> just a very few, and foreign residents within it,
> <a name="13:16:20">16:20</a> they wandered from nation to nation,
> and from one kingdom to another.
> <a name="13:16:21">16:21</a> He let no one oppress them,
> he disciplined kings for their sake,
> <a name="13:16:22">16:22</a> saying, “Don’t touch my anointed ones!
> Don’t harm my prophets!”
> <a name="13:16:23">16:23</a> Sing to the Lord, all the earth!
> Announce every day how he delivers!
> <a name="13:16:24">16:24</a> Tell the nations about his splendor,
> tell all the nations about his miraculous deeds!
> <a name="13:16:25">16:25</a> For the Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise,
> he is more awesome than all gods.
> <a name="13:16:26">16:26</a> For all the gods of the nations are worthless,
> but the Lord made the heavens.
> <a name="13:16:27">16:27</a> Majestic splendor emanates from him,
> he is the source of strength and joy.
> <a name="13:16:28">16:28</a> Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the nations,
> ascribe to the Lord splendor and strength!
> <a name="13:16:29">16:29</a> Ascribe to the Lord the splendor he deserves!
> Bring an offering and enter his presence!
> Worship the Lord in holy attire!
> <a name="13:16:30">16:30</a> Tremble before him, all the earth!

> <a name="13:16:36">16:36</a> May the Lord God of Israel be praised,
> in the future and forevermore.
> Then all the people said, “We agree! Praise the Lord!”

### David Appoints Worship Leaders

<a name="13:16:37">16:37</a> David left Asaph and his colleagues there before the ark of the Lord’s covenant to serve before the ark regularly and fulfill each day’s requirements, <a name="13:16:38">16:38</a> including Obed-Edom and sixty-eight colleagues. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers. <a name="13:16:39">16:39</a> Zadok the priest and his fellow priests served before the Lord’s tabernacle at the worship center in Gibeon, <a name="13:16:40">16:40</a> regularly offering burnt sacrifices to the Lord on the altar for burnt sacrifice, morning and evening, according to what is prescribed in the law of the Lord which he charged Israel to observe. <a name="13:16:41">16:41</a> Joining them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the Lord. (For his loyal love endures!) <a name="13:16:42">16:42</a> Heman and Jeduthun were in charge of the music, including the trumpets, cymbals, and the other musical instruments used in praising God. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the entrance.

<a name="13:16:43">16:43</a> Then all the people returned to their homes, and David went to pronounce a blessing on his family.

## Chapter 17

### God Makes a Promise to David

<a name="13:17:1">17:1</a> When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of the Lord’s covenant is under a tent.” <a name="13:17:2">17:2</a> Nathan said to David, “You should do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you.”

<a name="13:17:3">17:3</a> That night God told Nathan the prophet, <a name="13:17:4">17:4</a> “Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the Lord says: “You must not build me a house in which to live. <a name="13:17:5">17:5</a> For I have not lived in a house from the time I brought Israel up from Egypt to the present day. I have lived in a tent that has been in various places. <a name="13:17:6">17:6</a> Wherever I moved throughout Israel, I did not say to any of the leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, ‘Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?’”’

<a name="13:17:7">17:7</a> “So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the Lord who leads armies says: “I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you a leader of my people Israel. <a name="13:17:8">17:8</a> I was with you wherever you went and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth. <a name="13:17:9">17:9</a> I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning <a name="13:17:10">17:10</a> and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.

“‘“I declare to you that the Lord will build a “house” for you! <a name="13:17:11">17:11</a> When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom. <a name="13:17:12">17:12</a> He will build me a house, and I will make his dynasty permanent. <a name="13:17:13">17:13</a> I will become his father and he will become my son. I will never withhold my loyal love from him, as I withheld it from the one who ruled before you. <a name="13:17:14">17:14</a> I will put him in permanent charge of my house and my kingdom; his dynasty will be permanent.”’” <a name="13:17:15">17:15</a> Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.

### David Praises God

<a name="13:17:16">17:16</a> David went in, sat before the Lord, and said: “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family that you should have brought me to this point? <a name="13:17:17">17:17</a> And you didn’t stop there, O God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. You have revealed to me what men long to know, O Lord God. <a name="13:17:18">17:18</a> What more can David say to you? You have honored your servant; you have given your servant special recognition. <a name="13:17:19">17:19</a> O Lord, for the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing in order to reveal your greatness. <a name="13:17:20">17:20</a> O Lord, there is none like you; there is no God besides you. What we heard is true! <a name="13:17:21">17:21</a> And who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation in the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself! You made a name for yourself by doing great and awesome deeds when you drove out nations before your people whom you had delivered from the Egyptian empire and its gods. <a name="13:17:22">17:22</a> You made Israel your very own nation for all time. You, O Lord, became their God. <a name="13:17:23">17:23</a> And now, O Lord, may the promise you made about your servant and his family become a permanent reality! Do as you promised, <a name="13:17:24">17:24</a> so it may become a reality and you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The Lord who leads armies is the God of Israel.’ David’s dynasty will be established before you, <a name="13:17:25">17:25</a> for you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a dynasty for him. That is why your servant has had the courage to pray to you. <a name="13:17:26">17:26</a> Now, O Lord, you are the true God; you have made this good promise to your servant. <a name="13:17:27">17:27</a> Now you are willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Lord, have blessed it and it will be blessed on into the future.”

## Chapter 18

### David Conquers the Neighboring Nations

<a name="13:18:1">18:1</a> Later David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath and its surrounding towns away from the Philistines.

<a name="13:18:2">18:2</a> He defeated the Moabites; the Moabites became David’s subjects and brought tribute.

<a name="13:18:3">18:3</a> David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah as far as Hamath, when he went to extend his dominion to the Euphrates River. <a name="13:18:4">18:4</a> David seized from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand infantrymen. David cut the hamstrings of all but one hundred of Hadadezer’s chariot horses. <a name="13:18:5">18:5</a> The Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, but David killed twenty-two thousand of the Arameans. <a name="13:18:6">18:6</a> David placed garrisons in the territory of the Arameans of Damascus; the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The Lord protected David wherever he campaigned. <a name="13:18:7">18:7</a> David took the golden shields which Hadadezer’s servants had carried and brought them to Jerusalem. <a name="13:18:8">18:8</a> From Tibhath and Kun, Hadadezer’s cities, David took a great deal of bronze. (Solomon used it to make the big bronze basin called “The Sea,” the pillars, and other bronze items.

<a name="13:18:9">18:9</a> When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, <a name="13:18:10">18:10</a> he sent his son Hadoram to King David to extend his best wishes and to pronounce a blessing on him for his victory over Hadadezer, for Tou had been at war with Hadadezer. He also sent various items made of gold, silver, and bronze. <a name="13:18:11">18:11</a> King David dedicated these things to the Lord, along with the silver and gold which he had carried off from all the nations, including Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.

<a name="13:18:12">18:12</a> Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. <a name="13:18:13">18:13</a> He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. The Lord protected David wherever he campaigned.

### David’s Officials

<a name="13:18:14">18:14</a> David reigned over all Israel; he guaranteed justice for all his people. <a name="13:18:15">18:15</a> Joab son of Zeruiah was general of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary; <a name="13:18:16">18:16</a> Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe; <a name="13:18:17">18:17</a> Benaiah son of Jehoiada supervised the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were the king’s leading officials.

## Chapter 19

### David’s Campaign Against the Ammonites

<a name="13:19:1">19:1</a> Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him. <a name="13:19:2">19:2</a> David said, “I will express my loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash, for his father was loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy over his father’s death; David’s servants traveled to Ammonite territory to visit Hanun and express the king’s sympathy. <a name="13:19:3">19:3</a> The Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy? No, his servants have come to you so they can get information and spy out the land!” <a name="13:19:4">19:4</a> So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved their beards off. He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed and then sent them away. <a name="13:19:5">19:5</a> Messengers came and told David what had happened to the men, so he summoned them, for they were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back.”

<a name="13:19:6">19:6</a> When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand units of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah. <a name="13:19:7">19:7</a> They hired thirty-two thousand chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.

<a name="13:19:8">19:8</a> When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them. <a name="13:19:9">19:9</a> The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. <a name="13:19:10">19:10</a> When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans. <a name="13:19:11">19:11</a> He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites. <a name="13:19:12">19:12</a> Joab said, “If the Arameans start to overpower me, you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you, I will deliver you. <a name="13:19:13">19:13</a> Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The Lord will do what he decides is best.” <a name="13:19:14">19:14</a> So Joab and his men marched toward the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him. <a name="13:19:15">19:15</a> When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before his brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.

<a name="13:19:16">19:16</a> When the Arameans realized they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River, led by Shophach the general of Hadadezer’s army. <a name="13:19:17">19:17</a> When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and marched against them. David deployed his army against the Arameans for battle and they fought against him. <a name="13:19:18">19:18</a> The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand infantrymen; he also killed Shophach the general. <a name="13:19:19">19:19</a> When Hadadezer’s subjects saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.

## Chapter 20

<a name="13:20:1">20:1</a> In the spring, at the time when kings march off to war, Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down. <a name="13:20:2">20:2</a> David took the crown from the head of their king (its weight was a unit of gold and it was set with precious stones) and wore it. He took a large amount of plunder from the city. <a name="13:20:3">20:3</a> He took the city’s residents and made them work with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did this to all the cities of the Ammonites; then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.

### Battles with the Philistines

<a name="13:20:4">20:4</a> Later there was a battle with the Philistines in Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.

<a name="13:20:5">20:5</a> There was another battle with the Philistines in which Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom.

<a name="13:20:6">20:6</a> In a battle in Gath there was a very large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha. <a name="13:20:7">20:7</a> When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.

<a name="13:20:8">20:8</a> These were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his soldiers.

## Chapter 21

### The Lord Sends a Plague Against Israel

<a name="13:21:1">21:1</a> An adversary opposed Israel, inciting David to count how many warriors Israel had. <a name="13:21:2">21:2</a> David told Joab and the leaders of the army, “Go, count the number of warriors from Beer Sheba to Dan. Then bring back a report to me so I may know how many we have.” <a name="13:21:3">21:3</a> Joab replied, “May the Lord make his army a hundred times larger! My master, O king, do not all of them serve my master? Why does my master want to do this? Why bring judgment on Israel?”

<a name="13:21:4">21:4</a> But the king’s edict stood, despite Joab’s objections. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel before returning to Jerusalem. <a name="13:21:5">21:5</a> Joab reported to David the number of warriors. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had four hundred seventy thousand sword-wielding soldiers. <a name="13:21:6">21:6</a> Now Joab did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king’s edict disgusted him. <a name="13:21:7">21:7</a> God was also offended by it, so he attacked Israel.

<a name="13:21:8">21:8</a> David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” <a name="13:21:9">21:9</a> The Lord told Gad, David’s prophet, <a name="13:21:10">21:10</a> “Go, tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: “I am offering you three forms of judgment from which to choose. Pick one of them.”’” <a name="13:21:11">21:11</a> Gad went to David and told him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Pick one of these: <a name="13:21:12">21:12</a> three years of famine, or three months being chased by your enemies and struck down by their swords, or three days being struck down by the Lord, during which a plague will invade the land and the Lord’s messenger will destroy throughout Israel’s territory.’ Now, decide what I should tell the one who sent me.” <a name="13:21:13">21:13</a> David said to Gad, “I am very upset. I prefer to be attacked by the Lord, for his mercy is very great; I do not want to be attacked by men.” <a name="13:21:14">21:14</a> So the Lord sent a plague through Israel, and seventy thousand Israelite men died.

<a name="13:21:15">21:15</a> God sent a messenger to ravage Jerusalem. As he was doing so, the Lord watched and relented from his judgment. He told the messenger who was destroying, “That’s enough! Stop now!”

The Lord’s messenger was standing near the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <a name="13:21:16">21:16</a> David looked up and saw the Lord’s messenger standing between the earth and sky with his sword drawn and in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the leaders, covered with sackcloth, threw themselves down with their faces to the ground. <a name="13:21:17">21:17</a> David said to God, “Was I not the one who decided to number the army? I am the one who sinned and committed this awful deed! As for these sheep, what have they done? O Lord my God, attack me and my family, but remove the plague from your people!”

<a name="13:21:18">21:18</a> So the Lord’s messenger told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar for the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <a name="13:21:19">21:19</a> So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of the Lord. <a name="13:21:20">21:20</a> While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the messenger, and he and his four sons hid themselves. <a name="13:21:21">21:21</a> When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he came out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground. <a name="13:21:22">21:22</a> David said to Ornan, “Sell me the threshing floor so I can build on it an altar for the Lord—I’ll pay top price—so the plague may be removed from the people.” <a name="13:21:23">21:23</a> Ornan told David, “You can have it! My master, the king, may do what he wants. Look, I am giving you the oxen for burnt sacrifices, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for an offering. I give it all to you.” <a name="13:21:24">21:24</a> King David replied to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for top price. I will not offer to the Lord what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing. <a name="13:21:25">21:25</a> So David bought the place from Ornan for six hundred pieces of gold. <a name="13:21:26">21:26</a> David built there an altar for the Lord and offered burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace. He called out to the Lord, and the Lord responded by sending fire from the sky and consuming the burnt sacrifice on the altar. <a name="13:21:27">21:27</a> The Lord ordered the messenger to put his sword back into its sheath.

<a name="13:21:28">21:28</a> At that time, when David saw that the Lord responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. <a name="13:21:29">21:29</a> Now the Lord’s tabernacle, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar for burnt sacrifices were at that time at the worship center in Gibeon. <a name="13:21:30">21:30</a> But David could not go before it to seek God’s will, for he was afraid of the sword of the Lord’s messenger.

## Chapter 22

<a name="13:22:1">22:1</a> David then said, “This is the place where the temple of the Lord God will be, along with the altar for burnt sacrifices for Israel.

### David Orders a Temple to Be Built

<a name="13:22:2">22:2</a> David ordered the resident foreigners in the land of Israel to be called together. He appointed some of them to be stonecutters to chisel stones for the building of God’s temple. <a name="13:22:3">22:3</a> David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for braces, more bronze than could be weighed, <a name="13:22:4">22:4</a> and more cedar logs than could be counted. (The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large amount of cedar logs to David.)

<a name="13:22:5">22:5</a> David said, “My son Solomon is just an inexperienced young man, and the temple to be built for the Lord must be especially magnificent so it will become famous and be considered splendid by all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for its construction.” So David made extensive preparations before he died.

<a name="13:22:6">22:6</a> He summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel. <a name="13:22:7">22:7</a> David said to Solomon: “My son, I really wanted to build a temple to honor the Lord my God. <a name="13:22:8">22:8</a> But the Lord said to me: ‘You have spilled a great deal of blood and fought many battles. You must not build a temple to honor me, for you have spilled a great deal of blood on the ground before me. <a name="13:22:9">22:9</a> Look, you will have a son, who will be a peaceful man. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. Indeed, Solomon will be his name; I will give Israel peace and quiet during his reign. <a name="13:22:10">22:10</a> He will build a temple to honor me; he will become my son, and I will become his father. I will grant to his dynasty permanent rule over Israel.’

<a name="13:22:11">22:11</a> “Now, my son, may the Lord be with you! May you succeed and build a temple for the Lord your God, just as he announced you would. <a name="13:22:12">22:12</a> Only may the Lord give you insight and understanding when he places you in charge of Israel, so you may obey the law of the Lord your God. <a name="13:22:13">22:13</a> Then you will succeed, if you carefully obey the rules and regulations which the Lord ordered Moses to give to Israel. Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! <a name="13:22:14">22:14</a> Now, look, I have made every effort to supply what is needed to build the Lord’s temple. I have stored up one hundred thousand units of gold, one million units of silver, and so much bronze and iron it cannot be weighed, as well as wood and stones. Feel free to add more. <a name="13:22:15">22:15</a> You also have available many workers, including stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and an innumerable array of workers who are skilled <a name="13:22:16">22:16</a> in using gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get up and begin the work! May the Lord be with you!”

<a name="13:22:17">22:17</a> David ordered all the officials of Israel to support his son Solomon. <a name="13:22:18">22:18</a> He told them, “The Lord your God is with you! He has made you secure on every side, for he handed over to me the inhabitants of the region and the region is subdued before the Lord and his people. <a name="13:22:19">22:19</a> Now seek the Lord your God wholeheartedly and with your entire being! Get up and build the sanctuary of the Lord God! Then you can bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant and the holy items dedicated to God’s service into the temple that is built to honor the Lord.”

## Chapter 23

### David Organizes the Levites

<a name="13:23:1">23:1</a> When David was old and approaching the end of his life, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.

<a name="13:23:2">23:2</a> David assembled all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites. <a name="13:23:3">23:3</a> The Levites who were thirty years old and up were counted; there were thirty-eight thousand men. <a name="13:23:4">23:4</a> David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to direct the work of the Lord’s temple; six thousand are to be officials and judges; <a name="13:23:5">23:5</a> four thousand are to be gatekeepers; and four thousand are to praise the Lord with the instruments I supplied for worship.” <a name="13:23:6">23:6</a> David divided them into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<a name="13:23:7">23:7</a> The Gershonites included Ladan and Shimei.

<a name="13:23:8">23:8</a> The sons of Ladan:

Jehiel the oldest, Zetham, and Joel—three in all.

<a name="13:23:9">23:9</a> The sons of Shimei:

Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all.

These were the leaders of the family of Ladan.

<a name="13:23:10">23:10</a> The sons of Shimei:

Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were Shimei’s sons—four in all. <a name="13:23:11">23:11</a> Jahath was the oldest and Zizah the second oldest. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered one family with one responsibility.

<a name="13:23:12">23:12</a> The sons of Kohath:

Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all.

<a name="13:23:13">23:13</a> The sons of Amram:

Aaron and Moses.

Aaron and his descendants were chosen on a permanent basis to consecrate the most holy items, to offer sacrifices before the Lord, to serve him, and to praise his name. <a name="13:23:14">23:14</a> The descendants of Moses the man of God were considered Levites.

<a name="13:23:15">23:15</a> The sons of Moses:

Gershom and Eliezer.

<a name="13:23:16">23:16</a> The son of Gershom:

Shebuel the oldest.

<a name="13:23:17">23:17</a> The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah, the oldest. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.

<a name="13:23:18">23:18</a> The son of Izhar:

Shelomith the oldest.

<a name="13:23:19">23:19</a> The sons of Hebron:

Jeriah the oldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<a name="13:23:20">23:20</a> The sons of Uzziel:

Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.

<a name="13:23:21">23:21</a> The sons of Merari:

Machli and Mushi.

The sons of Machli:

Eleazar and Kish.

<a name="13:23:22">23:22</a> Eleazar died without having sons; he had only daughters. The sons of Kish, their cousins, married them.

<a name="13:23:23">23:23</a> The sons of Mushi:

Machli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three in all.

<a name="13:23:24">23:24</a> These were the descendants of Levi according to their families, that is, the leaders of families as counted and individually listed who carried out assigned tasks in the Lord’s temple and were twenty years old and up. <a name="13:23:25">23:25</a> For David said, “The Lord God of Israel has given his people rest and has permanently settled in Jerusalem. <a name="13:23:26">23:26</a> So the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the items used in its service.” <a name="13:23:27">23:27</a> According to David’s final instructions, the Levites twenty years old and up were counted.

<a name="13:23:28">23:28</a> Their job was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the Lord’s temple. They were to take care of the courtyards, the rooms, ceremonial purification of all holy items, and other jobs related to the service of God’s temple. <a name="13:23:29">23:29</a> They also took care of the bread that is displayed, the flour for offerings, the unleavened wafers, the round cakes, the mixing, and all the measuring. <a name="13:23:30">23:30</a> They also stood in a designated place every morning and offered thanks and praise to the Lord. They also did this in the evening <a name="13:23:31">23:31</a> and whenever burnt sacrifices were offered to the Lord on the Sabbath and at new moon festivals and assemblies. A designated number were to serve before the Lord regularly in accordance with regulations. <a name="13:23:32">23:32</a> They were in charge of the meeting tent and the holy place, and helped their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, in the service of the Lord’s temple.

## Chapter 24

### David Organizes the Priests

<a name="13:24:1">24:1</a> The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows:

The sons of Aaron:

Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<a name="13:24:2">24:2</a> Nadab and Abihu died before their father did; they had no sons. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.

<a name="13:24:3">24:3</a> David, Zadok (a descendant of Eleazar), and Ahimelech (a descendant of Ithamar) divided them into groups to carry out their assigned responsibilities. <a name="13:24:4">24:4</a> The descendants of Eleazar had more leaders than the descendants of Ithamar, so they divided them up accordingly; the descendants of Eleazar had sixteen leaders, while the descendants of Ithamar had eight. <a name="13:24:5">24:5</a> They divided them by lots, for there were officials of the holy place and officials designated by God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. <a name="13:24:6">24:6</a> The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names before the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then the next from Ithamar.

<a name="13:24:7">24:7</a> The first lot went to Jehoiarib,

the second to Jedaiah,

<a name="13:24:8">24:8</a> the third to Harim,

the fourth to Seorim,

<a name="13:24:9">24:9</a> the fifth to Malkijah,

the sixth to Mijamin,

<a name="13:24:10">24:10</a> the seventh to Hakkoz,

the eighth to Abijah,

<a name="13:24:11">24:11</a> the ninth to Jeshua,

the tenth to Shecaniah,

<a name="13:24:12">24:12</a> the eleventh to Eliashib,

the twelfth to Jakim,

<a name="13:24:13">24:13</a> the thirteenth to Huppah,

the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

<a name="13:24:14">24:14</a> the fifteenth to Bilgah,

the sixteenth to Immer,

<a name="13:24:15">24:15</a> the seventeenth to Hezir,

the eighteenth to Happizzez,

<a name="13:24:16">24:16</a> the nineteenth to Pethahiah,

the twentieth to Jehezkel,

<a name="13:24:17">24:17</a> the twenty-first to Jakin,

the twenty-second to Gamul,

<a name="13:24:18">24:18</a> the twenty-third to Delaiah,

the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

<a name="13:24:19">24:19</a> This was the order in which they carried out their assigned responsibilities when they entered the Lord’s temple, according to the regulations given them by their ancestor Aaron, just as the Lord God of Israel had instructed him.

### Remaining Levites

<a name="13:24:20">24:20</a> The rest of the Levites included:

Shubael from the sons of Amram,

Jehdeiah from the sons of Shubael,

<a name="13:24:21">24:21</a> the firstborn Isshiah from Rehabiah and the sons of Rehabiah,

Jahath from the sons of Shelomoth.

<a name="13:24:23">24:23</a> The sons of Hebron:

Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<a name="13:24:24">24:24</a> The son of Uzziel:

Jerahmeel.

<a name="13:24:30">24:30</a> The sons of Mushi:

Machli, Eder, and Jerimoth.

### David Commissions Solomon to Build the Temple

<a name="13:28:1">28:1</a> David assembled in Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, including the commanders of the tribes, the commanders of the army divisions that served the king, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, the officials who were in charge of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, the eunuchs, and the warriors, including the most skilled of them.

<a name="13:28:2">28:2</a> King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I wanted to build a temple where the ark of the Lord’s covenant could be placed as a footstool for our God. I have made the preparations for building it. <a name="13:28:3">28:3</a> But God said to me, ‘You must not build a temple to honor me, for you are a warrior and have spilled blood.’ <a name="13:28:4">28:4</a> The Lord God of Israel chose me out of my father’s entire family to become king over Israel and have a permanent dynasty. Indeed he chose Judah as leader, and my father’s family within Judah, and then he picked me out from among my father’s sons and made me king over all Israel. <a name="13:28:5">28:5</a> From all the many sons the Lord has given me, he chose Solomon my son to rule on his behalf over Israel. <a name="13:28:6">28:6</a> He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to become my son and I will become his father. <a name="13:28:7">28:7</a> I will establish his kingdom permanently, if he remains committed to obeying my commands and regulations, as you are doing this day.’ <a name="13:28:8">28:8</a> So now, in the sight of all Israel, the Lord’s assembly, and in the hearing of our God, I say this: Carefully observe all the commands of the Lord your God, so you may possess the good land and may leave it as a permanent inheritance for your children after you.

<a name="13:28:9">28:9</a> “And you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father and serve him with a submissive attitude and a willing spirit, for the Lord examines all minds and understands every motive of one’s thoughts. If you seek him, he will meet with you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently. <a name="13:28:10">28:10</a> Realize now that the Lord has chosen you to build a temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it!”

<a name="13:28:11">28:11</a> David gave to his son Solomon the blueprints for the temple porch, its buildings, its treasuries, its upper areas, its inner rooms, and the room for atonement. <a name="13:28:12">28:12</a> He gave him the blueprints of all he envisioned for the courts of the Lord’s temple, all the surrounding rooms, the storehouses of God’s temple, and the storehouses for the holy items.

<a name="13:28:13">28:13</a> He gave him the regulations for the divisions of priests and Levites, for all the assigned responsibilities within the Lord’s temple, and for all the items used in the service of the Lord’s temple.

<a name="13:28:14">28:14</a> He gave him the prescribed weight for all the gold items to be used in various types of service in the Lord’s temple, for all the silver items to be used in various types of service, <a name="13:28:15">28:15</a> for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, for the silver lampstands, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, according to the prescribed use of each lampstand, <a name="13:28:16">28:16</a> for the gold used in the display tables, including the amount to be used in each table, for the silver to be used in the silver tables, <a name="13:28:17">28:17</a> for the pure gold used for the meat forks, bowls, and jars, for the small gold bowls, including the weight for each bowl, for the small silver bowls, including the weight for each bowl, <a name="13:28:18">28:18</a> and for the refined gold of the incense altar.

He gave him the blueprint for the seat of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and provide shelter for the ark of the Lord’s covenant.

<a name="13:28:19">28:19</a> David said, “All of this I put in writing as the Lord directed me and gave me insight regarding the details of the blueprints.”

<a name="13:28:20">28:20</a> David said to his son Solomon: “Be strong and brave! Do it! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! For the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not leave you or abandon you before all the work for the service of the Lord’s temple is finished. <a name="13:28:21">28:21</a> Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites who will perform all the service of God’s temple. All the willing and skilled men are ready to assist you in all the work and perform their service. The officials and all the people are ready to follow your instructions.”

## Chapter 29

### The People Contribute to the Project

<a name="13:29:1">29:1</a> King David said to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is just an inexperienced young man, and the task is great, for this palace is not for man, but for the Lord God. <a name="13:29:2">29:2</a> So I have made every effort to provide what is needed for the temple of my God, including the gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, as well as a large amount of onyx, settings of antimony and other stones, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster. <a name="13:29:3">29:3</a> Now, to show my commitment to the temple of my God, I donate my personal treasure of gold and silver to the temple of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for this holy temple. <a name="13:29:4">29:4</a> This includes three thousand units of gold from Ophir and seven thousand units of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings, <a name="13:29:5">29:5</a> for gold and silver items, and for all the work of the craftsmen. Who else wants to contribute to the Lord today?”

<a name="13:29:6">29:6</a> The leaders of the families, the leaders of the Israelite tribes, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, and the supervisors of the king’s work contributed willingly. <a name="13:29:7">29:7</a> They donated for the service of God’s temple five thousand units and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand units of silver, eighteen thousand units of bronze, and one hundred thousand units of iron. <a name="13:29:8">29:8</a> All who possessed precious stones donated them to the treasury of the Lord’s temple, which was under the supervision of Jehiel the Gershonite. <a name="13:29:9">29:9</a> The people were delighted with their donations, for they contributed to the Lord with a willing attitude; King David was also very happy.

### David Praises the Lord

<a name="13:29:10">29:10</a> David praised the Lord before the entire assembly:

“O Lord God of our father Israel, you deserve praise forevermore! <a name="13:29:11">29:11</a> O Lord, you are great, mighty, majestic, magnificent, glorious, and sovereign over all the sky and earth! You have dominion and exalt yourself as the ruler of all. <a name="13:29:12">29:12</a> You are the source of wealth and honor; you rule over all. You possess strength and might to magnify and give strength to all. <a name="13:29:13">29:13</a> Now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your majestic name.

<a name="13:29:14">29:14</a> “But who am I and who are my people, that we should be in a position to contribute this much? Indeed, everything comes from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours. <a name="13:29:15">29:15</a> For we are resident foreigners and nomads in your presence, like all our ancestors; our days are like a shadow on the earth, without security. <a name="13:29:16">29:16</a> O Lord our God, all this wealth, which we have collected to build a temple for you to honor your holy name, comes from you; it all belongs to you. <a name="13:29:17">29:17</a> I know, my God, that you examine thoughts and are pleased with integrity. With pure motives I contribute all this; and now I look with joy as your people who have gathered here contribute to you. <a name="13:29:18">29:18</a> O Lord God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, maintain the motives of your people and keep them devoted to you. <a name="13:29:19">29:19</a> Make my son Solomon willing to obey your commands, rules, and regulations, and to complete building the palace for which I have made preparations.”

<a name="13:29:20">29:20</a> David told the entire assembly: “Praise the Lord your God!” So the entire assembly praised the Lord God of their ancestors; they bowed down and stretched out flat on the ground before the Lord and the king.

### David Designates Solomon King
