> <a name="31:1:1">1:1</a> The vision that Obadiah saw:
> The Lord God says this concerning Edom.

### Edom’s Approaching Destruction

> We have heard a report from the Lord.
> An envoy was sent among the nations, saying,
> “Arise! Let us make war against Edom!”
> <a name="31:1:2">1:2</a> The Lord says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation;
> you will be greatly despised!
> <a name="31:1:3">1:3</a> Your presumptuous heart has deceived you—
> you who reside in the safety of the rocky cliffs,
> whose abode is high in the mountains.
> You think to yourself,
> ‘No one can bring me down to the ground!’
> <a name="31:1:4">1:4</a> Even if you were to soar high like an eagle,
> even if you were to make your nest among the stars,
> even from there I can bring you down!” says the Lord.
> <a name="31:1:5">1:5</a> “If thieves came to rob you during the night,
> they would steal only as much as appealed to them!
> If grape pickers came to harvest your vineyards,
> they would leave some behind for the poor!
> But you will be totally destroyed!
> <a name="31:1:6">1:6</a> How the people of Esau will be thoroughly plundered!
> Their hidden valuables will be ransacked!
> <a name="31:1:7">1:7</a> All your allies will force you from your homeland!
> Your treaty partners will deceive you and overpower you.
> Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you,
> which will take you by surprise!
> <a name="31:1:8">1:8</a> In that day,” the Lord says,
> “I will destroy the wise sages of Edom!
> the advisers from Esau’s mountain!
> <a name="31:1:9">1:9</a> Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman,
> so that everyone will be destroyed from Esau’s mountain!

### Edom’s Treachery Against Judah

> <a name="31:1:10">1:10</a> “Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob,
> shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
> <a name="31:1:11">1:11</a> You stood aloof while strangers took his army captive,
> and foreigners advanced to his gates.
> When they cast lots over Jerusalem,
> you behaved as though you were in league with them.
> <a name="31:1:12">1:12</a> You should not have gloated when your relatives suffered calamity.
> You should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah when they were destroyed.
> You should not have boasted when they suffered adversity.
> <a name="31:1:13">1:13</a> You should not have entered the city of my people when they experienced distress.
> You should not have joined in gloating over their misfortune when they suffered distress.
> You should not have looted their wealth when they endured distress.
> <a name="31:1:14">1:14</a> You should not have stood at the fork in the road to slaughter those escaping.
> You should not have captured their refugees when they suffered adversity.

### The Coming Day of the Lord

> <a name="31:1:15">1:15</a> “For the day of the Lord is approaching for all the nations!
> Just as you have done, so it will be done to you.
> You will get exactly what your deeds deserve.
> <a name="31:1:16">1:16</a> For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
> so all the nations will drink continually.
> They will drink, and they will gulp down;
> they will be as though they had never been.
> <a name="31:1:17">1:17</a> But on Mount Zion there will be a remnant of those who escape,
> and it will be a holy place once again.
> The descendants of Jacob will conquer
> those who had conquered them.
> <a name="31:1:18">1:18</a> The descendants of Jacob will be a fire,
> and the descendants of Joseph a flame.
> The descendants of Esau will be like stubble.
> They will burn them up and devour them.
> There will not be a single survivor of the descendants of Esau!”
> Indeed, the Lord has so spoken.
> <a name="31:1:19">1:19</a> The people of the Negev will take possession of Esau’s mountain,
> and the people of the Shephelah will take possession of the land of the Philistines.
> They will also take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,
> and the people of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.
> <a name="31:1:20">1:20</a> The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel
> will take possession of what belongs to the people of Canaan, as far as Zarephath,
> and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
> will take possession of the towns of the Negev.
> <a name="31:1:21">1:21</a> Those who have been delivered will go up on Mount Zion
> in order to rule over Esau’s mountain.
> Then the Lord will reign as King!
