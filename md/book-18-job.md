# Job

## I. Meeting Job and the Setting (<a>1:1-2:13</a>)

### Chapter 1

<a name="18:1:1">1:1</a> There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was pure and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. <a name="18:1:2">1:2</a> Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. <a name="18:1:3">1:3</a> His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.

<a name="18:1:4">1:4</a> Now, his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <a name="18:1:5">1:5</a> When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job customarily did this.

#### Satan’s Accusation of Job

<a name="18:1:6">1:6</a> Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord—and Satan also came among them. <a name="18:1:7">1:7</a> The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” And Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” <a name="18:1:8">1:8</a> So the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”

<a name="18:1:9">1:9</a> Then Satan answered the Lord, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God? <a name="18:1:10">1:10</a> Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have increased in the land. <a name="18:1:11">1:11</a> But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will indeed curse you to your face!”

<a name="18:1:12">1:12</a> So the Lord said to Satan, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.

#### Job’s Integrity in Adversity

<a name="18:1:13">1:13</a> Now the day came when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <a name="18:1:14">1:14</a> and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing beside them, <a name="18:1:15">1:15</a> and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”

<a name="18:1:16">1:16</a> While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants—it has consumed them! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”

<a name="18:1:17">1:17</a> While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”

<a name="18:1:18">1:18</a> While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <a name="18:1:19">1:19</a> and suddenly there came a great wind across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”

<a name="18:1:20">1:20</a> Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he fell down to the ground with his face to the ground. <a name="18:1:21">1:21</a> He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. May the name of the Lord be blessed!” <a name="18:1:22">1:22</a> In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety.

### Chapter 2

#### Satan’s Additional Charge 

<a name="18:2:1">2:1</a> Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord. <a name="18:2:2">2:2</a> And the Lord said to Satan, “Where do you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” <a name="18:2:3">2:3</a> Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds firmly his integrity, so that you stirred me up to destroy him without reason.”

<a name="18:2:4">2:4</a> But Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give up all that he has to save his life! <a name="18:2:5">2:5</a> But extend your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will indeed curse you to your face!”

<a name="18:2:6">2:6</a> So the Lord said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power; only preserve his life.”

#### Job’s Integrity in Suffering

<a name="18:2:7">2:7</a> So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and he afflicted Job with a malignant ulcer from the sole of his feet to the top of his head. <a name="18:2:8">2:8</a> Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape himself with while he was sitting among the ashes.

<a name="18:2:9">2:9</a> Then his wife said to him, “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God, and die!” <a name="18:2:10">2:10</a> But he replied, “You are speaking like one of the godless women would speak! Should we receive what is good from God, and not also receive what is evil?” In all this Job did not sin by what he said.

#### The Visit of Job’s Friends

<a name="18:2:11">2:11</a> When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to show grief for him and to console him. <a name="18:2:12">2:12</a> But when they gazed intently from a distance but could not recognize him, they began to weep loudly. Each of them tore his robes, and they threw dust into the air over their heads. <a name="18:2:13">2:13</a> Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.

## II. Job’s Dialogue With His Friends (<a>3:1-27:33</a>)

### Chapter 3

#### Job Regrets His Birth 

<a name="18:3:1">3:1</a> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born. <a name="18:3:2">3:2</a> Job spoke up and said:

> <a name="18:3:3">3:3</a> “Let the day in which I was born perish,
> and the night that said,
> ‘A man has been conceived!’
> <a name="18:3:4">3:4</a> That day—let it be darkness;
> let not God on high regard it,
> nor let light shine on it!
> <a name="18:3:5">3:5</a> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it;
> let a cloud settle on it;
> let whatever blackens the day terrify it!
> <a name="18:3:6">3:6</a> That night—let darkness seize it;
> let it not be included among the days of the year;
> let it not enter among the number of the months!
> <a name="18:3:7">3:7</a> Indeed, let that night be barren;
> let no shout of joy penetrate it!
> <a name="18:3:8">3:8</a> Let those who curse the day curse it—
> those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
> <a name="18:3:9">3:9</a> Let its morning stars be darkened;
> let it wait for daylight but find none,
> nor let it see the first rays of dawn,
> <a name="18:3:10">3:10</a> because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me,
> nor did it hide trouble from my eyes!

#### Job Wishes He Had Died at Birth

> <a name="18:3:11">3:11</a> “Why did I not die at birth,
> and why did I not expire
> when I came out of the womb?
> <a name="18:3:12">3:12</a> Why did the knees welcome me,
> and why were there two breasts
> that I might nurse at them?
> <a name="18:3:13">3:13</a> For now I would be lying down
> and would be quiet,
> I would be asleep and then at peace
> <a name="18:3:14">3:14</a> with kings and counselors of the earth
> who built for themselves places now desolate,
> <a name="18:3:15">3:15</a> or with princes who had gold,
> who filled their houses with silver.
> <a name="18:3:16">3:16</a> Or why was I not buried
> like a stillborn infant,
> like infants who have never seen the light?
> <a name="18:3:17">3:17</a> There the wicked cease from turmoil,
> and there the weary are at rest.
> <a name="18:3:18">3:18</a> There the prisoners rest together;
> they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
> <a name="18:3:19">3:19</a> Small and great are there,
> and the slave is free from his master.

#### Longing for Death

> <a name="18:3:20">3:20</a> “Why does God give light to one who is in misery,
> and life to those whose soul is bitter,
> <a name="18:3:21">3:21</a> to those who wait for death that does not come,
> and search for it
> more than for hidden treasures,
> <a name="18:3:22">3:22</a> who rejoice even to jubilation,
> and are exultant when they find the grave?
> <a name="18:3:23">3:23</a> Why is light given to a man
> whose way is hidden,
> and whom God has hedged in?
> <a name="18:3:24">3:24</a> For my sighing comes in place of my food,
> and my groanings flow forth like water.
> <a name="18:3:25">3:25</a> For the thing that I dreaded has happened to me,
> and what I feared has come upon me.
> <a name="18:3:26">3:26</a> I have no ease, I have no quietness;
> I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”

### Chapter 4

#### Eliphaz Begins to Speak 

<a name="18:4:1">4:1</a> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

> <a name="18:4:2">4:2</a> “If someone should attempt a word with you,
> will you be impatient?
> But who can refrain from speaking?
> <a name="18:4:3">4:3</a> Look, you have instructed many,
> you have strengthened feeble hands.
> <a name="18:4:4">4:4</a> Your words have supported those who stumbled,
> and you have strengthened the knees
> that gave way.
> <a name="18:4:5">4:5</a> But now the same thing comes to you,
> and you are discouraged;
> it strikes you,
> and you are terrified.
> <a name="18:4:6">4:6</a> Is not your piety your confidence,
> and your blameless ways your hope?
> <a name="18:4:7">4:7</a> Call to mind now:
> Who, being innocent, ever perished?
> And where were upright people ever destroyed?
> <a name="18:4:8">4:8</a> Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity
> and those who sow trouble reap the same.
> <a name="18:4:9">4:9</a> By the breath of God they perish,
> and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
> <a name="18:4:10">4:10</a> There is the roaring of the lion
> and the growling of the young lion,
> but the teeth of the young lions are broken.
> <a name="18:4:11">4:11</a> The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey,
> and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

#### Ungodly Complainers Provoke God’s Wrath

> <a name="18:4:12">4:12</a> “Now a word was secretly brought to me,
> and my ear caught a whisper of it.
> <a name="18:4:13">4:13</a> In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night
> when a deep sleep falls on men,
> <a name="18:4:14">4:14</a> a trembling gripped me—and a terror!—
> and made all my bones shake.
> <a name="18:4:15">4:15</a> Then a breath of air passes by my face;
> it makes the hair of my flesh stand up.
> <a name="18:4:16">4:16</a> It stands still,
> but I cannot recognize its appearance;
> an image is before my eyes,
> and I hear a murmuring voice:
> <a name="18:4:17">4:17</a> “Is a mortal man righteous before God?
> Or a man pure before his Creator?
> <a name="18:4:18">4:18</a> If God puts no trust in his servants
> and attributes folly to his angels,
> <a name="18:4:19">4:19</a> how much more to those who live in houses of clay,
> whose foundation is in the dust,
> who are crushed like a moth?
> <a name="18:4:20">4:20</a> They are destroyed from morning to evening;
> they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
> <a name="18:4:21">4:21</a> Is not their excess wealth taken away from them?
> They die, yet without attaining wisdom.

### Chapter 5

> <a name="18:5:1">5:1</a> “Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you?
> To which of the holy ones will you turn?
> <a name="18:5:2">5:2</a> For wrath kills the foolish person,
> and anger slays the silly one.
> <a name="18:5:3">5:3</a> I myself have seen the fool taking root,
> but suddenly I cursed his place of residence.
> <a name="18:5:4">5:4</a> His children are far from safety,
> and they are crushed at the place of judgment,
> nor is there anyone to deliver them.
> <a name="18:5:5">5:5</a> The hungry eat up his harvest,
> and take it even out of the thorns,
> and the thirsty swallow up their fortune.
> <a name="18:5:6">5:6</a> For evil does not come up from the dust,
> nor does trouble spring up from the ground,
> <a name="18:5:7">5:7</a> but people are born to trouble,
> as surely as the sparks fly upward.

#### Blessings for the One Who Seeks God

> <a name="18:5:8">5:8</a> “But as for me, I would seek God,
> and to God I would set forth my case.
> <a name="18:5:9">5:9</a> He does great and unsearchable things,
> marvelous things without number;
> <a name="18:5:10">5:10</a> he gives rain on the earth,
> and sends water upon the fields;
> <a name="18:5:11">5:11</a> he sets the lowly on high,
> that those who mourn are raised to safety.
> <a name="18:5:12">5:12</a> He frustrates the plans of the crafty
> so that their hands do not accomplish
> what they had planned!
> <a name="18:5:13">5:13</a> He catches the wise in their own craftiness,
> and the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end.
> <a name="18:5:14">5:14</a> They meet with darkness in the daytime,
> and grope about in the noontime as if it were night.
> <a name="18:5:15">5:15</a> So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth,
> even the poor from the hand of the powerful.
> <a name="18:5:16">5:16</a> Thus the poor have hope,
> and iniquity shuts its mouth.
> <a name="18:5:17">5:17</a> “Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects,
> so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
> <a name="18:5:18">5:18</a> For he wounds, but he also bandages;
> he strikes, but his hands also heal.
> <a name="18:5:19">5:19</a> He will deliver you from six calamities;
> yes, in seven no evil will touch you.
> <a name="18:5:20">5:20</a> In time of famine he will redeem you from death,
> and in time of war from the power of the sword.
> <a name="18:5:21">5:21</a> You will be protected from malicious gossip,
> and will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes.
> <a name="18:5:22">5:22</a> You will laugh at destruction and famine
> and need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
> <a name="18:5:23">5:23</a> For you will have a pact with the stones of the field,
> and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
> <a name="18:5:24">5:24</a> And you will know that your home
> will be secure,
> and when you inspect your domains,
> you will not be missing anything.
> <a name="18:5:25">5:25</a> You will also know that your children will be numerous,
> and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
> <a name="18:5:26">5:26</a> You will come to your grave in a full age,
> As stacks of grain are harvested in their season.
> <a name="18:5:27">5:27</a> Look, we have investigated this, so it is true.
> Hear it, and apply it for your own good.”

### Chapter 6

#### Job Replies to Eliphaz 

<a name="18:6:1">6:1</a> Then Job responded:

> <a name="18:6:2">6:2</a> “Oh if only my grief could be weighed,
> and my misfortune laid on the scales too!
> <a name="18:6:3">6:3</a> But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea,
> that is why my words have been wild.
> <a name="18:6:4">6:4</a> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;
> my spirit drinks their poison;
> God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.

#### Complaints Reflect Suffering

> <a name="18:6:5">6:5</a> “Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass?
> Or does the ox low near its fodder?
> <a name="18:6:6">6:6</a> Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt?
> Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
> <a name="18:6:7">6:7</a> I have refused to touch such things;
> they are like loathsome food to me.

#### A Cry for Death

> <a name="18:6:8">6:8</a> “Oh that my request would be realized,
> and that God would grant me what I long for!
> <a name="18:6:9">6:9</a> And that God would be willing to crush me,
> that he would let loose his hand
> and kill me.
> <a name="18:6:10">6:10</a> Then I would yet have my comfort,
> then I would rejoice,
> in spite of pitiless fear,
> for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
> <a name="18:6:11">6:11</a> What is my strength, that I should wait?
> and what is my end,
> that I should prolong my life?
> <a name="18:6:12">6:12</a> Is my strength like that of stones?
> or is my flesh of bronze?
> <a name="18:6:13">6:13</a> Is not my power to help myself nothing,
> and has not every resource been driven from me?

#### Disappointing Friends

> <a name="18:6:14">6:14</a> “To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend
> even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
> <a name="18:6:15">6:15</a> My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream,
> and as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams
> that flow away.
> <a name="18:6:16">6:16</a> They are dark because of ice;
> snow is piled up over them.
> <a name="18:6:17">6:17</a> When they are warmed, they dry up,
> when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
> <a name="18:6:18">6:18</a> Caravans turn aside from their routes;
> they go into the wasteland and perish.
> <a name="18:6:19">6:19</a> The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams;
> the traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them.
> <a name="18:6:20">6:20</a> They were distressed,
> because each one had been so confident;
> they arrived there, but were disappointed.
> <a name="18:6:21">6:21</a> For now you have become like these streams that are no help;
> you see a terror, and are afraid.

#### Friends’ Fears

> <a name="18:6:22">6:22</a> “Have I ever said, ‘Give me something,
> and from your fortune make gifts in my favor’?
> <a name="18:6:23">6:23</a> Or ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s power,
> and from the hand of tyrants ransom me’?

#### No Sin Discovered

> <a name="18:6:24">6:24</a> “Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent;
> explain to me how I have been mistaken.
> <a name="18:6:25">6:25</a> How painful are honest words!
> But what does your reproof prove?
> <a name="18:6:26">6:26</a> Do you intend to criticize mere words,
> and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
> <a name="18:6:27">6:27</a> Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless,
> and auction off your friend.

#### Other Explanation

> <a name="18:6:28">6:28</a> “Now then, be good enough to look at me;
> and I will not lie to your face!
> <a name="18:6:29">6:29</a> Relent, let there be no falsehood;
> reconsider, for my righteousness is intact!
> <a name="18:6:30">6:30</a> Is there any falsehood on my lips?
> Can my mouth not discern evil things?

### Chapter 7

#### The Brevity of Life 

> <a name="18:7:1">7:1</a> “Does not man have hard service on earth?
> Are not his days also
> like the days of a hired man?
> <a name="18:7:2">7:2</a> Like a servant longing for the evening shadow,
> and like a hired man looking for his wages.
> <a name="18:7:3">7:3</a> Thus I have been made to inherit
> months of futility,
> and nights of sorrow
> have been appointed to me.
> <a name="18:7:4">7:4</a> If I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise?’,
> and the night stretches on
> and I am full of tossing to and fro
> unto the dawning of the day.
> <a name="18:7:5">7:5</a> My body is clothed with worms and dirty scabs;
> my skin is broken and festering.
> <a name="18:7:6">7:6</a> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle
> and they come to an end without hope.
> <a name="18:7:7">7:7</a> Remember that my life is but a breath,
> that my eyes will never again see happiness.
> <a name="18:7:8">7:8</a> The eye of him who sees me now will see me no more;
> your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
> <a name="18:7:9">7:9</a> As a cloud is dispersed and then disappears,
> so the one who goes down to the grave
> does not come up again.
> <a name="18:7:10">7:10</a> He returns no more to his house,
> nor does his place know him any more.

#### Job Remonstrates With God

> <a name="18:7:11">7:11</a> “Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth;
> I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
> I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
> <a name="18:7:12">7:12</a> Am I the sea, or the creature of the deep,
> that you must set a watch over me?
> <a name="18:7:13">7:13</a> If I say, “My bed will comfort me,
> my couch will ease my complaint,”
> <a name="18:7:14">7:14</a> then you scare me with dreams
> and terrify me with visions,
> <a name="18:7:15">7:15</a> so that I would prefer strangling,
> and death more than life.
> <a name="18:7:16">7:16</a> I loathe it; I would not live forever;
> leave me alone, for my days are a vapor!

#### Insignificance of Humans

> <a name="18:7:17">7:17</a> “What is man that you make so much of him,
> and that you pay attention to him?
> <a name="18:7:18">7:18</a> And that you visit him every morning,
> and try him every moment?
> <a name="18:7:19">7:19</a> Will you never look away from me,
> will you not let me alone
> long enough to swallow my spittle?
> <a name="18:7:20">7:20</a> If I have sinned—what have I done to you,
> O watcher of men?
> Why have you set me as your target?
> Have I become a burden to you?
> <a name="18:7:21">7:21</a> And why do you not pardon my transgression,
> and take away my iniquity?
> For now I will lie down in the dust,
> and you will seek me diligently,
> but I will be gone.”

### Chapter 8

#### Bildad’s First Speech to Job 

<a name="18:8:1">8:1</a> Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:

> <a name="18:8:2">8:2</a> “How long will you speak these things,
> seeing that the words of your mouth
> are like a great wind?

#### Job’s Reply to Bildad 

<a name="18:9:1">9:1</a> Then Job answered:

### Chapter 11

#### Zophar’s First Speech to Job 

<a name="18:11:1">11:1</a> Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:

### Chapter 12

#### Job’s Reply to Zophar 

<a name="18:12:1">12:1</a> Then Job answered:

> <a name="18:12:2">12:2</a> “Doubtless, you are the people,

### Chapter 14

#### The Inevitability of Death

### Chapter 15

#### Eliphaz’s Second Speech 

<a name="18:15:1">15:1</a> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

> <a name="18:15:2">15:2</a> “Does a wise man answer with blustery knowledge,
> or fill his belly with the east wind?
> <a name="18:15:3">15:3</a> Does he argue with useless talk,

> <a name="18:15:4">15:4</a> But you even break off piety,

> <a name="18:15:5">15:5</a> Your sin inspires your mouth;

> <a name="18:15:6">15:6</a> Your own mouth condemns you, not I;

> <a name="18:15:7">15:7</a> “Were you the first man ever born?
> Were you brought forth before the hills?
> <a name="18:15:8">15:8</a> Do you listen in God’s council?

> <a name="18:15:9">15:9</a> What do you know that we do not know?
> What do you understand that is not understood by us?
> <a name="18:15:10">15:10</a> The gray-haired and the aged are on our side,
> men far older than your father.
> <a name="18:15:11">15:11</a> Are God’s consolations too trivial for you;
> or a word spoken in gentleness to you?
> <a name="18:15:12">15:12</a> Why has your heart carried you away,
> and why do your eyes flash,
> <a name="18:15:13">15:13</a> when you turn your rage against God

> <a name="18:15:14">15:14</a> What is man that he should be pure,
> or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
> <a name="18:15:15">15:15</a> If God places no trust in his holy ones,
> if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
> <a name="18:15:16">15:16</a> how much less man, who is abominable and corrupt,
> who drinks in evil like water!
> <a name="18:15:17">15:17</a> “I will explain to you; listen to me,
> and what I have seen, I will declare,
> <a name="18:15:18">15:18</a> what wise men declare,

> <a name="18:15:19">15:19</a> to whom alone the land was given

> <a name="18:15:20">15:20</a> All his days the wicked man suffers torment,

> <a name="18:15:21">15:21</a> Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
> in a time of peace marauders attack him.
> <a name="18:15:22">15:22</a> He does not expect to escape from darkness;
> he is marked for the sword;
> <a name="18:15:23">15:23</a> he wanders about—food for vultures;
> he knows that the day of darkness is at hand.
> <a name="18:15:24">15:24</a> Distress and anguish terrify him;
> they prevail against him
> like a king ready for attack,
> <a name="18:15:25">15:25</a> for he stretches out his hand against God,
> and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
> <a name="18:15:26">15:26</a> defiantly charging against him
> with a thick, strong shield!
> <a name="18:15:27">15:27</a> Because he covered his face with fat,
> and made his hips fat,
> <a name="18:15:28">15:28</a> he lived in ruined towns
> and in houses where no one lives,
> where they are ready to crumble into heaps.
> <a name="18:15:29">15:29</a> He will not grow rich,
> and his wealth will not endure,
> nor will his possessions spread over the land.
> <a name="18:15:30">15:30</a> He will not escape the darkness;
> a flame will wither his shoots
> and he will depart
> by the breath of God’s mouth.
> <a name="18:15:31">15:31</a> Let him not trust in what is worthless,
> deceiving himself;
> for worthlessness will be his reward.
> <a name="18:15:32">15:32</a> Before his time he will be paid in full,
> and his branches will not flourish.
> <a name="18:15:33">15:33</a> Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall,

> <a name="18:15:34">15:34</a> For the company of the godless is barren,

### Chapter 16

#### Job’s Reply to Eliphaz 

<a name="18:16:1">16:1</a> Then Job replied:

> <a name="18:16:2">16:2</a> “I have heard many things like these before.
> Miserable comforters are you all!
> <a name="18:16:3">16:3</a> Will there be an end to your windy words?
> Or what provokes you that you answer?
> <a name="18:16:4">16:4</a> I also could speak like you,
> if you were in my place;
> I could pile up words against you
> and I could shake my head at you.
> <a name="18:16:5">16:5</a> But I would strengthen you with my words;
> comfort from my lips would bring you relief.

#### Abandonment by God and Man

> <a name="18:16:6">16:6</a> “But if I speak, my pain is not assuaged,
> and if I refrain from speaking
> —how much of it goes away?
> <a name="18:16:7">16:7</a> Surely now he has worn me out,
> you have devastated my entire household.
> <a name="18:16:8">16:8</a> You have seized me,
> and it has become a witness;
> my leanness has risen up against me
> and testifies against me.
> <a name="18:16:9">16:9</a> His anger has torn me and persecuted me;
> he has gnashed at me with his teeth;
> my adversary fastens his eyes on me.
> <a name="18:16:10">16:10</a> People have opened their mouths against me,
> they have struck my cheek in scorn;
> they unite together against me.
> <a name="18:16:11">16:11</a> God abandons me to evil men,
> and throws me into the hands of wicked men.
> <a name="18:16:12">16:12</a> I was in peace, and he has shattered me.
> He has seized me by the neck and crushed me.
> He has made me his target;
> <a name="18:16:13">16:13</a> his archers surround me.
> Without pity he pierces my kidneys
> and pours out my gall on the ground.
> <a name="18:16:14">16:14</a> He breaks through against me, time and time again;
> he rushes against me like a warrior.
> <a name="18:16:15">16:15</a> I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
> and buried my horn in the dust;
> <a name="18:16:16">16:16</a> my face is reddened because of weeping,
> and on my eyelids there is a deep darkness,
> <a name="18:16:17">16:17</a> although there is no violence in my hands
> and my prayer is pure.

#### An Appeal to God as Witness

> <a name="18:16:18">16:18</a> “O earth, do not cover my blood,
> nor let there be a secret place for my cry.
> <a name="18:16:19">16:19</a> Even now my witness is in heaven;
> my advocate is on high.
> <a name="18:16:20">16:20</a> My intercessor is my friend
> as my eyes pour out tears to God;
> <a name="18:16:21">16:21</a> and he contends with God on behalf of man
> as a man pleads for his friend.
> <a name="18:16:22">16:22</a> For the years that lie ahead are few,
> and then I will go on the way of no return.

### Chapter 17

> <a name="18:17:1">17:1</a> My spirit is broken,
> my days have faded out,
> the grave awaits me.
> <a name="18:17:2">17:2</a> Surely mockery is with me;

> <a name="18:17:3">17:3</a> Make then my pledge with you.
> Who else will put up security for me?
> <a name="18:17:4">17:4</a> Because you have closed their minds to understanding,
> therefore you will not exalt them.
> <a name="18:17:5">17:5</a> If a man denounces his friends for personal gain,
> the eyes of his children will fail.
> <a name="18:17:6">17:6</a> He has made me a byword to people,
> I am the one in whose face they spit.
> <a name="18:17:7">17:7</a> My eyes have grown dim with grief;
> my whole frame is but a shadow.
> <a name="18:17:8">17:8</a> Upright men are appalled at this;
> the innocent man is troubled with the godless.
> <a name="18:17:9">17:9</a> But the righteous man holds to his way,
> and the one with clean hands grows stronger.

#### Anticipation of Death

> <a name="18:17:10">17:10</a> “But turn, all of you, and come now!
> I will not find a wise man among you.
> <a name="18:17:11">17:11</a> My days have passed, my plans are shattered,
> even the desires of my heart.
> <a name="18:17:12">17:12</a> These men change night into day;
> they say, ‘The light is near
> in the face of darkness.’
> <a name="18:17:13">17:13</a> If I hope for the grave to be my home,
> if I spread out my bed in darkness,
> <a name="18:17:14">17:14</a> If I cry to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
> and to the worm, ‘My Mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
> <a name="18:17:15">17:15</a> and where then is my hope?
> And my hope, who sees it?
> <a name="18:17:16">17:16</a> Will it go down to the bars of death?
> Will we descend together into the dust?”

### Chapter 18

#### Bildad’s Second Speech 

<a name="18:18:1">18:1</a> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:

> <a name="18:18:2">18:2</a> “How long until you make an end of words?
> You must consider, and then we can talk.
> <a name="18:18:3">18:3</a> Why should we be regarded as beasts,

> <a name="18:18:4">18:4</a> You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger,

> <a name="18:18:7">18:7</a> His vigorous steps are restricted,

> <a name="18:18:8">18:8</a> For he has been thrown into a net by his feet

> <a name="18:18:10">18:10</a> A rope is hidden for him on the ground

> <a name="18:18:11">18:11</a> Terrors frighten him on all sides

> <a name="18:18:12">18:12</a> Calamity is hungry for him,

> <a name="18:18:13">18:13</a> It eats away parts of his skin;
> the most terrible death devours his limbs.
> <a name="18:18:14">18:14</a> He is dragged from the security of his tent,

> <a name="18:18:20">18:20</a> People of the west are appalled at his fate;

### Chapter 19

#### Job’s Reply to Bildad 

<a name="18:19:1">19:1</a> Then Job answered:

> <a name="18:19:2">19:2</a> “How long will you torment me

> <a name="18:19:3">19:3</a> These ten times you have been reproaching me;

> <a name="18:19:6">19:6</a> know then that God has wronged me

#### Job’s Abandonment and Affliction

> <a name="18:19:7">19:7</a> “If I cry out, ‘Violence!’
> I receive no answer;
> I cry for help,
> but there is no justice.
> <a name="18:19:8">19:8</a> He has blocked my way so I cannot pass,

#### Job’s Forsaken State

### Chapter 20

#### Zophar’s Second Speech 

<a name="18:20:1">20:1</a> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:

> <a name="18:20:2">20:2</a> “This is why my troubled thoughts bring me back

> <a name="18:20:3">20:3</a> When I hear a reproof that dishonors me,

### Chapter 21

> <a name="18:21:6">21:6</a> For, when I think about this, I am terrified

#### The Wicked Prosper

> <a name="18:21:7">21:7</a> “Why do the wicked go on living,

#### How Often Do the Wicked Suffer?

> <a name="18:21:17">21:17</a> “How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished?

#### Death Levels Everything

> <a name="18:21:23">21:23</a> “One man dies in his full vigor,

> <a name="18:21:24">21:24</a> his body well nourished,

> <a name="18:21:26">21:26</a> Together they lie down in the dust,

#### Futile Words, Deceptive Answers

> <a name="18:21:27">21:27</a> “Yes, I know what you are thinking,

> <a name="18:21:28">21:28</a> For you say,

### Chapter 22

#### Eliphaz’s Third Speech 

<a name="18:22:1">22:1</a> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

> <a name="18:22:2">22:2</a> “Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit?
> Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?
> <a name="18:22:3">22:3</a> Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty
> that you should be righteous,
> or is it any gain to him
> that you make your ways blameless?
> <a name="18:22:4">22:4</a> Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you
> and goes to judgment with you?
> <a name="18:22:5">22:5</a> Is not your wickedness great
> and is there no end to your iniquity?
> <a name="18:22:6">22:6</a> “For you took pledges from your brothers
> for no reason,
> and you stripped the clothing from the naked.
> <a name="18:22:7">22:7</a> You gave the weary no water to drink
> and from the hungry you withheld food.
> <a name="18:22:8">22:8</a> Although you were a powerful man, owning land,
> an honored man living on it,
> <a name="18:22:9">22:9</a> you sent widows away empty-handed,
> and the arms of the orphans are crushed.
> <a name="18:22:10">22:10</a> That is why snares surround you,
> and why sudden fear terrifies you,
> <a name="18:22:11">22:11</a> why it is so dark you cannot see,
> and why a flood of water covers you.
> <a name="18:22:12">22:12</a> “Is not God on high in heaven?
> And see the lofty stars, how high they are!
> <a name="18:22:13">22:13</a> But you have said, ‘What does God know?
> Does he judge through such deep darkness?
> <a name="18:22:14">22:14</a> Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us,
> as he goes back and forth
> in the vault of heaven.’
> <a name="18:22:15">22:15</a> Will you keep to the old path

> <a name="18:22:16">22:16</a> men who were carried off before their time,

> on their foundations?
> <a name="18:22:17">22:17</a> They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’
> and ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
> <a name="18:22:18">22:18</a> But it was he who filled their houses

> <a name="18:22:19">22:19</a> The righteous see their destruction and rejoice;

> <a name="18:22:20">22:20</a> ‘Surely our enemies are destroyed,

> <a name="18:22:21">22:21</a> “Reconcile yourself with God,

> among the rocks in the ravines—
> <a name="18:22:25">22:25</a> then the Almighty himself will be your gold,
> and the choicest silver for you.
> <a name="18:22:26">22:26</a> Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
> and will lift up your face toward God.
> <a name="18:22:27">22:27</a> You will pray to him and he will hear you,
> and you will fulfill your vows to him.
> <a name="18:22:28">22:28</a> Whatever you decide on a matter,

> <a name="18:22:29">22:29</a> When people are brought low and you say
> ‘Lift them up!’
> then he will save the downcast;
> <a name="18:22:30">22:30</a> he will deliver even someone who is not innocent,
> who will escape through the cleanness of your hands.”

### Chapter 23

#### Job’s Reply to Eliphaz 

<a name="18:23:1">23:1</a> Then Job answered:

> <a name="18:23:2">23:2</a> “Even today my complaint is still bitter;
> his hand is heavy despite my groaning.
> <a name="18:23:3">23:3</a> O that I knew where I might find him,

> <a name="18:23:4">23:4</a> I would lay out my case before him

> <a name="18:23:5">23:5</a> I would know with what words he would answer me,
> and understand what he would say to me.
> <a name="18:23:6">23:6</a> Would he contend with me with great power?
> No, he would only pay attention to me.
> <a name="18:23:7">23:7</a> There an upright person

#### The Inaccessibility and Power of God

> <a name="18:23:8">23:8</a> “If I go to the east, he is not there,
> and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.
> <a name="18:23:9">23:9</a> In the north when he is at work,

> when he turns to the south,

> <a name="18:23:10">23:10</a> But he knows the pathway that I take;
> if he tested me, I would come forth like gold.
> <a name="18:23:11">23:11</a> My feet have followed his steps closely;
> I have kept to his way and have not turned aside.
> <a name="18:23:12">23:12</a> I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
> I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion.
> <a name="18:23:13">23:13</a> But he is unchangeable, and who can change him?
> Whatever he has desired, he does.
> <a name="18:23:14">23:14</a> For he fulfills his decree against me,
> and many such things are his plans.
> <a name="18:23:15">23:15</a> That is why I am terrified in his presence;
> when I consider, I am afraid because of him.
> <a name="18:23:16">23:16</a> Indeed, God has made my heart faint;
> the Almighty has terrified me.
> <a name="18:23:17">23:17</a> Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness,

> that covered my face.

### Chapter 24

#### The Apparent Indifference of God 

> <a name="18:24:1">24:1</a> “Why are times not appointed by the Almighty?
> Why do those who know him not see his days?
> <a name="18:24:2">24:2</a> Men move boundary stones;

> <a name="18:24:3">24:3</a> They drive away the orphan’s donkey;

> <a name="18:24:4">24:4</a> They turn the needy from the pathway,

> <a name="18:24:5">24:5</a> Like wild donkeys in the desert

> seeking diligently for food;

> <a name="18:24:6">24:6</a> They reap fodder in the field,
> and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
> <a name="18:24:7">24:7</a> They spend the night naked because they lack clothing;
> they have no covering against the cold.
> <a name="18:24:8">24:8</a> They are soaked by mountain rains
> and huddle in the rocks because they lack shelter.
> <a name="18:24:9">24:9</a> The fatherless child is snatched from the breast,
> the infant of the poor is taken as a pledge.
> <a name="18:24:10">24:10</a> They go about naked, without clothes,

> <a name="18:24:11">24:11</a> They press out the oil among the olive rows;

> <a name="18:24:12">24:12</a> From the city the dying groan,
> and the wounded cry out for help,

> <a name="18:24:13">24:13</a> There are those who rebel against the light;

> <a name="18:24:14">24:14</a> Before daybreak the murderer rises up;

> <a name="18:24:15">24:15</a> And the eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight,

> <a name="18:24:16">24:16</a> In the dark the robber breaks into houses,

> <a name="18:24:17">24:17</a> For all of them, the morning is to them

### Chapter 25

#### Bildad’s Third Speech 

<a name="18:25:1">25:1</a> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:

> <a name="18:25:2">25:2</a> “Dominion and awesome might belong to God;
> he establishes peace in his heights.
> <a name="18:25:3">25:3</a> Can his armies be numbered?
> On whom does his light not rise?
> <a name="18:25:4">25:4</a> How then can a human being be righteous before God?
> How can one born of a woman be pure?
> <a name="18:25:5">25:5</a> If even the moon is not bright,
> and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
> <a name="18:25:6">25:6</a> how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot—
> a son of man, who is only a worm!”

### Chapter 26

#### Job’s Reply to Bildad 

<a name="18:26:1">26:1</a> Then Job replied:

> <a name="18:26:2">26:2</a> “How you have helped the powerless!
> How you have saved the person who has no strength!
> <a name="18:26:3">26:3</a> How you have advised the one without wisdom,
> and abundantly revealed your insight!
> <a name="18:26:4">26:4</a> To whom did you utter these words?
> And whose spirit has come forth from your mouth?

#### A Better Description of God’s Greatness

> <a name="18:26:5">26:5</a> “The dead tremble—
> those beneath the waters
> and all that live in them.
> <a name="18:26:6">26:6</a> The underworld is naked before God;

> <a name="18:26:7">26:7</a> He spreads out the northern skies over empty space;
> he suspends the earth on nothing.
> <a name="18:26:8">26:8</a> He locks the waters in his clouds,
> and the clouds do not burst with the weight of them.
> <a name="18:26:9">26:9</a> He conceals the face of the full moon,
> shrouding it with his clouds.
> <a name="18:26:10">26:10</a> He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters
> as a boundary between light and darkness.
> <a name="18:26:11">26:11</a> The pillars of the heavens tremble
> and are amazed at his rebuke.
> <a name="18:26:12">26:12</a> By his power he stills the sea;

> <a name="18:26:13">26:13</a> By his breath the skies became fair;

> <a name="18:26:14">26:14</a> Indeed, these are but the outer fringes of his ways!

> But who can understand the thunder of his power?”

### Chapter 27

#### A Protest of Innocence 

<a name="18:27:1">27:1</a> And Job took up his discourse again:

> <a name="18:27:2">27:2</a> “As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,
> the Almighty, who has made my life bitter—
> <a name="18:27:3">27:3</a> for while my spirit is still in me,
> and the breath from God is in my nostrils,
> <a name="18:27:4">27:4</a> my lips will not speak wickedness,

> <a name="18:27:5">27:5</a> I will never declare that you are in the right;
> until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!
> <a name="18:27:6">27:6</a> I will maintain my righteousness
> and never let it go;
> my conscience will not reproach me
> for as long as I live.

#### The Condition of the Wicked

> <a name="18:27:7">27:7</a> “May my enemy be like the wicked,
> my adversary like the unrighteous.
> <a name="18:27:8">27:8</a> For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off,

> <a name="18:27:9">27:9</a> Does God listen to his cry
> when distress overtakes him?
> <a name="18:27:10">27:10</a> Will he find delight in the Almighty?
> Will he call out to God at all times?
> <a name="18:27:11">27:11</a> I will teach you about the power of God;
> What is on Shaddai’s mind I will not conceal.
> <a name="18:27:12">27:12</a> If you yourselves have all seen this,
> Why in the world do you continue this meaningless talk?
> <a name="18:27:13">27:13</a> This is the portion of the wicked man

> the inheritance that evildoers receive

> <a name="18:27:14">27:14</a> If his children increase—it is for the sword!
> His offspring never have enough to eat.
> <a name="18:27:15">27:15</a> Those who survive him are buried by the plague,
> and their widows do not mourn for them.
> <a name="18:27:16">27:16</a> If he piles up silver like dust
> and stores up clothing like mounds of clay,
> <a name="18:27:17">27:17</a> what he stores up a righteous man will wear,
> and an innocent man will inherit his silver.
> <a name="18:27:18">27:18</a> The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon,
> like a hut that a watchman has made.
> <a name="18:27:19">27:19</a> He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more.
> When he opens his eyes, it is all gone.
> <a name="18:27:20">27:20</a> Terrors overwhelm him like a flood;
> at night a whirlwind carries him off.

> <a name="18:27:23">27:23</a> It claps its hands at him in derision
> and hisses him away from his place.

## III. Job’s Search for Wisdom (<a name="18:28:1">28:1</a>-28)

### Chapter 28

#### No Known Road to Wisdom 

> <a name="18:28:1">28:1</a> “Surely there is a mine for silver,
> and a place where gold is refined.
> <a name="18:28:2">28:2</a> Iron is taken from the ground,
> and rock is poured out as copper.
> <a name="18:28:3">28:3</a> Man puts an end to the darkness;
> he searches the farthest recesses
> for the ore in the deepest darkness.
> <a name="18:28:4">28:4</a> Far from where people live he sinks a shaft,
> in places travelers have long forgotten,
> far from other people he dangles and sways.
> <a name="18:28:5">28:5</a> The earth, from which food comes,
> is overturned below as though by fire;
> <a name="18:28:6">28:6</a> a place whose stones are sapphires
> and which contains dust of gold;
> <a name="18:28:7">28:7</a> a hidden path no bird of prey knows—
> no falcon’s eye has spotted it.
> <a name="18:28:8">28:8</a> Proud beasts have not set foot on it,
> and no lion has passed along it.
> <a name="18:28:9">28:9</a> On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand;
> he has overturned mountains at their bases.
> <a name="18:28:10">28:10</a> He has cut out channels through the rocks;
> his eyes have spotted every precious thing.
> <a name="18:28:11">28:11</a> He has searched the sources of the rivers
> and what was hidden he has brought into the light.

#### No Price Can Buy Wisdom

> <a name="18:28:12">28:12</a> “But wisdom—where can it be found?
> Where is the place of understanding?
> <a name="18:28:13">28:13</a> Mankind does not know its place;
> it cannot be found in the land of the living.
> <a name="18:28:14">28:14</a> The deep says, ‘It is not with me.’
> And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
> <a name="18:28:15">28:15</a> Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it,
> nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
> <a name="18:28:16">28:16</a> It cannot be measured out for purchase with the gold of Ophir,
> with precious onyx or sapphires.
> <a name="18:28:17">28:17</a> Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it,
> nor can a vase of gold match its worth.
> <a name="18:28:18">28:18</a> Of coral and jasper no mention will be made;
> the price of wisdom is more than pearls.
> <a name="18:28:19">28:19</a> The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it;
> it cannot be purchased with pure gold.

#### God Alone Has Wisdom

> <a name="18:28:20">28:20</a> “But wisdom—from where does it come?
> Where is the place of understanding?
> <a name="18:28:21">28:21</a> For it has been hidden
> from the eyes of every living creature,
> and from the birds of the sky it has been concealed.
> <a name="18:28:22">28:22</a> Destruction and Death say,
> ‘With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.’
> <a name="18:28:23">28:23</a> God understands the way to it,
> and he alone knows its place.
> <a name="18:28:24">28:24</a> For he looks to the ends of the earth
> and observes everything under the heavens.
> <a name="18:28:25">28:25</a> When he made the force of the wind
> and measured the waters with a gauge.
> <a name="18:28:26">28:26</a> When he imposed a limit for the rain,
> and a path for the thunderstorm,
> <a name="18:28:27">28:27</a> then he looked at wisdom and assessed its value;
> he established it and examined it closely.
> <a name="18:28:28">28:28</a> And he said to mankind,
> ‘The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,
> and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”

## IV. Job’s Concluding Soliloquy (<a>29:1-31:40</a>)

### Chapter 29

#### Job Recalls His Former Condition 

<a name="18:29:1">29:1</a> Then Job continued his speech:

> <a name="18:29:2">29:2</a> “O that I could be as I was

> <a name="18:29:3">29:3</a> when he caused his lamp

> and by his light
> I walked through darkness;
> <a name="18:29:4">29:4</a> just as I was in my productive time,

> <a name="18:29:5">29:5</a> when the Almighty was still with me

> <a name="18:29:6">29:6</a> when my steps were bathed with butter

> <a name="18:29:10">29:10</a> the voices of the nobles fell silent,
> and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.

#### Job’s Benevolence

> <a name="18:29:11">29:11</a> “As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me,
> and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,
> <a name="18:29:12">29:12</a> for I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
> and the orphan who had no one to assist him;
> <a name="18:29:13">29:13</a> the blessing of the dying man descended on me,
> and I made the widow’s heart rejoice;
> <a name="18:29:14">29:14</a> I put on righteousness and it clothed me,
> my just dealing was like a robe and a turban;
> <a name="18:29:15">29:15</a> I was eyes for the blind
> and feet for the lame;
> <a name="18:29:16">29:16</a> I was a father to the needy,
> and I investigated the case of the person I did not know;
> <a name="18:29:17">29:17</a> I broke the fangs of the wicked,
> and made him drop his prey from his teeth.

#### Job’s Confidence

> <a name="18:29:18">29:18</a> “Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home,
> my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
> <a name="18:29:19">29:19</a> My roots reach the water,
> and the dew lies on my branches all night long.
> <a name="18:29:20">29:20</a> My glory will always be fresh in me,
> and my bow ever new in my hand.’

#### Job’s Reputation

> <a name="18:29:21">29:21</a> “People listened to me and waited silently;
> they kept silent for my advice.
> <a name="18:29:22">29:22</a> After I had spoken, they did not respond;
> my words fell on them drop by drop.
> <a name="18:29:23">29:23</a> They waited for me as people wait for the rain,
> and they opened their mouths
> as for the spring rains.
> <a name="18:29:24">29:24</a> If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it;
> and they did not cause the light of my face to darken.
> <a name="18:29:25">29:25</a> I chose the way for them
> and sat as their chief;
> I lived like a king among his troops;
> I was like one who comforts mourners.

### Chapter 30

#### Job’s Present Misery 

> <a name="18:30:1">30:1</a> “But now they mock me, those who are younger than I,
> whose fathers I disdained too much
> to put with my sheep dogs.
> <a name="18:30:2">30:2</a> Moreover, the strength of their hands—
> what use was it to me?
> Men whose strength had perished;
> <a name="18:30:3">30:3</a> gaunt with want and hunger,
> they would gnaw the parched land,
> in former time desolate and waste.
> <a name="18:30:4">30:4</a> By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes,
> and the root of the broom tree was their food.
> <a name="18:30:5">30:5</a> They were banished from the community—
> people shouted at them
> like they would at thieves—
> <a name="18:30:6">30:6</a> so that they had to live
> in the dry stream beds,
> in the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.
> <a name="18:30:7">30:7</a> They brayed like animals among the bushes
> and were huddled together under the nettles.
> <a name="18:30:8">30:8</a> Sons of senseless and nameless people,
> they were driven out of the land with whips.

#### Job’s Indignities

> <a name="18:30:9">30:9</a> “And now I have become their taunt song;
> I have become a byword among them.
> <a name="18:30:10">30:10</a> They detest me and maintain their distance;
> they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
> <a name="18:30:11">30:11</a> Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me,
> people throw off all restraint in my presence.
> <a name="18:30:12">30:12</a> On my right the young rabble rise up;
> they drive me from place to place,
> and build up siege ramps against me.
> <a name="18:30:13">30:13</a> They destroy my path;
> they succeed in destroying me
> without anyone helping them.
> <a name="18:30:14">30:14</a> They come in as through a wide breach;
> amid the crash they come rolling in.
> <a name="18:30:15">30:15</a> Terrors are turned loose on me;
> they drive away my honor like the wind,
> and like a cloud my deliverance has passed away.

#### Job’s Despondency

> <a name="18:30:16">30:16</a> “And now my soul pours itself out within me;
> days of suffering take hold of me.
> <a name="18:30:17">30:17</a> Night pierces my bones;
> my gnawing pains never cease.
> <a name="18:30:18">30:18</a> With great power God grasps my clothing;
> he binds me like the collar of my tunic.
> <a name="18:30:19">30:19</a> He has flung me into the mud,
> and I have come to resemble dust and ashes.
> <a name="18:30:20">30:20</a> I cry out to you, but you do not answer me;
> I stand up, and you only look at me.
> <a name="18:30:21">30:21</a> You have become cruel to me;
> with the strength of your hand you attack me.
> <a name="18:30:22">30:22</a> You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it;
> you toss me about in the storm.
> <a name="18:30:23">30:23</a> I know that you are bringing me to death,
> to the meeting place for all the living.

#### The Contrast With the Past

> <a name="18:30:24">30:24</a> “Surely one does not stretch out his hand
> against a broken man
> when he cries for help in his distress.
> <a name="18:30:25">30:25</a> Have I not wept for the unfortunate?
> Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
> <a name="18:30:26">30:26</a> But when I hoped for good, trouble came;
> when I expected light, then darkness came.
> <a name="18:30:27">30:27</a> My heart is in turmoil unceasingly;
> the days of my affliction confront me.
> <a name="18:30:28">30:28</a> I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
> in the assembly I stand up and cry for help.
> <a name="18:30:29">30:29</a> I have become a brother to jackals
> and a companion of ostriches.
> <a name="18:30:30">30:30</a> My skin has turned dark on me;

> <a name="18:30:31">30:31</a> My harp is used for mourning

### Chapter 31

#### Job Vindicates Himself 

> <a name="18:31:1">31:1</a> “I made a covenant with my eyes;
> how then could I pay attention to a virgin?
> <a name="18:31:2">31:2</a> What then would be one’s lot from God above,
> one’s heritage from the Almighty on high?
> <a name="18:31:3">31:3</a> Is it not misfortune for the unjust,
> and disaster for those who work iniquity?
> <a name="18:31:4">31:4</a> Does he not see my ways

> <a name="18:31:5">31:5</a> If I have walked in falsehood,

> <a name="18:31:7">31:7</a> If my footsteps have strayed from the way,

 ## V. The Speeches of Elihu (<a>32:1-37:24</a>)

### Chapter 32

#### Elihu’s First Speech 

<a name="18:32:1">32:1</a> So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes. <a name="18:32:2">32:2</a> Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. <a name="18:32:3">32:3</a> With Job’s three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty. <a name="18:32:4">32:4</a> Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he. <a name="18:32:5">32:5</a> But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.

#### Elihu Claims Wisdom

<a name="18:32:6">32:6</a> So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up:

> “I am young, but you are elderly;
> that is why I was fearful,
> and afraid to explain to you what I know.
> <a name="18:32:7">32:7</a> I said to myself, ‘Age should speak,
> and length of years should make wisdom known.’
> <a name="18:32:8">32:8</a> But it is a spirit in people,
> the breath of the Almighty,
> that makes them understand.
> <a name="18:32:9">32:9</a> It is not the aged who are wise,
> nor old men who understand what is right.
> <a name="18:32:10">32:10</a> Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me.
> I, even I, will explain what I know.’
> <a name="18:32:11">32:11</a> Look, I waited for you to speak;
> I listened closely to your wise thoughts,while you were searching for words.
> <a name="18:32:12">32:12</a> Now I was giving you close attention,
> yet there was no one proving Job wrong,
> not one of you was answering his statements!
> <a name="18:32:13">32:13</a> So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom!
> God will refute him, not man!’
> <a name="18:32:14">32:14</a> Job has not directed his words to me,
> and so I will not reply to him with your arguments.

#### Job’s Friends Failed to Answer

> <a name="18:32:15">32:15</a> “They are dismayed and cannot answer any more;
> they have nothing left to say.
> <a name="18:32:16">32:16</a> And I have waited. But because they do not speak,
> because they stand there and answer no more,
> <a name="18:32:17">32:17</a> I too will answer my part,
> I too will explain what I know.
> <a name="18:32:18">32:18</a> For I am full of words,
> and the spirit within me constrains me.
> <a name="18:32:19">32:19</a> Inside I am like wine which has no outlet,
> like new wineskins ready to burst!
> <a name="18:32:20">32:20</a> I will speak, so that I may find relief;
> I will open my lips, so that I may answer.
> <a name="18:32:21">32:21</a> I will not show partiality to anyone,
> nor will I confer a title on any man.
> <a name="18:32:22">32:22</a> for I do not know how to give honorary titles,
> if I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me.

### Chapter 33

#### Elihu Invites Job’s Attention 

> <a name="18:33:1">33:1</a> “But now, O Job, listen to my words,
> and hear everything I have to say!
> <a name="18:33:2">33:2</a> See now, I have opened my mouth;
> my tongue in my mouth has spoken.
> <a name="18:33:3">33:3</a> My words come from the uprightness of my heart,
> and my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.
> <a name="18:33:4">33:4</a> The Spirit of God has made me,
> and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
> <a name="18:33:5">33:5</a> Reply to me, if you can;
> set your arguments in order before me
> and take your stand!
> <a name="18:33:6">33:6</a> Look, I am just like you in relation to God;
> I too have been molded from clay.
> <a name="18:33:7">33:7</a> Therefore no fear of me should terrify you,
> nor should my pressure be heavy on you.

#### Elihu Rejects Job’s Plea of Innocence

> <a name="18:33:8">33:8</a> “Indeed, you have said in my hearing
> (I heard the sound of the words!):
> <a name="18:33:9">33:9</a> ‘I am pure, without transgression;
> I am clean and have no iniquity.
> <a name="18:33:10">33:10</a> Yet God finds occasions with me;
> he regards me as his enemy!
> <a name="18:33:11">33:11</a> He puts my feet in shackles;
> he watches closely all my paths.’
> <a name="18:33:12">33:12</a> Now in this, you are not right—I answer you,
> for God is greater than a human being.
> <a name="18:33:13">33:13</a> Why do you contend against him,
> that he does not answer all a person’s words?

#### Elihu Disagrees With Job’s View of God

> <a name="18:33:14">33:14</a> “For God speaks, the first time in one way,
> the second time in another,
> though a person does not perceive it.
> <a name="18:33:15">33:15</a> In a dream, a night vision,
> when deep sleep falls on people
> as they sleep in their beds.
> <a name="18:33:16">33:16</a> Then he gives a revelation to people,
> and terrifies them with warnings,
> <a name="18:33:17">33:17</a> to turn a person from his sin,
> and to cover a person’s pride.
> <a name="18:33:18">33:18</a> He spares a person’s life from corruption,
> his very life from crossing over the river.
> <a name="18:33:19">33:19</a> Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed,
> and with the continual strife of his bones,
> <a name="18:33:20">33:20</a> so that his life loathes food,
> and his soul rejects appetizing food.
> <a name="18:33:21">33:21</a> His flesh wastes away from sight,
> and his bones, which were not seen,
> are easily visible.
> <a name="18:33:22">33:22</a> He draws near to the place of corruption,
> and his life to the messengers of death.
> <a name="18:33:23">33:23</a> If there is an angel beside him,
> one mediator out of a thousand,
> to tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;
> <a name="18:33:24">33:24</a> and if God is gracious to him and says,
> ‘Spare him from going down
> to the place of corruption,
> I have found a ransom for him,’
> <a name="18:33:25">33:25</a> then his flesh is restored like a youth’s;
> he returns to the days of his youthful vigor.
> <a name="18:33:26">33:26</a> He entreats God, and God delights in him,
> he sees God’s face with rejoicing,
> and God restores to him his righteousness.
> <a name="18:33:27">33:27</a> That person sings to others, saying:
> ‘I have sinned and falsified what is right,
> but I was not punished according to what I deserved.
> <a name="18:33:28">33:28</a> He redeemed my life
> from going down to the place of corruption,
> and my life sees the light!’

#### Elihu’s Appeal to Job

> <a name="18:33:29">33:29</a> “Indeed, God does all these things,
> twice, three times, in his dealings with a person,
> <a name="18:33:30">33:30</a> to turn back his life from the place of corruption,
> that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
> <a name="18:33:31">33:31</a> Pay attention, Job—listen to me;
> be silent, and I will speak.
> <a name="18:33:32">33:32</a> If you have any words, reply to me;
> speak, for I want to justify you.
> <a name="18:33:33">33:33</a> If not, you listen to me;
> be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”

### Chapter 34

#### Elihu’s Second Speech 

<a name="18:34:1">34:1</a> Elihu answered:

> <a name="18:34:2">34:2</a> “Listen to my words, you wise men;
> hear me, you learned men.
> <a name="18:34:3">34:3</a> For the ear assesses words
> as the mouth tastes food.
> <a name="18:34:4">34:4</a> Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right;
> let us come to know among ourselves what is good.
> <a name="18:34:5">34:5</a> For Job says, ‘I am innocent,
> but God turns away my right.
> <a name="18:34:6">34:6</a> Concerning my right, should I lie?
> My wound is incurable,
> although I am without transgression.’
> <a name="18:34:7">34:7</a> What man is like Job,
> who drinks derision like water!
> <a name="18:34:8">34:8</a> He goes about in company with evildoers,
> he goes along with wicked men.
> <a name="18:34:9">34:9</a> For he says, ‘It does not profit a man
> when he makes his delight with God.’

#### God is Not Unjust

> <a name="18:34:10">34:10</a> “Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
> Far be it from God to do wickedness,
> from the Almighty to do evil.
> <a name="18:34:11">34:11</a> For he repays a person for his work,
> and according to the conduct of a person,
> he causes the consequences to find him.
> <a name="18:34:12">34:12</a> Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly,
> and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
> <a name="18:34:13">34:13</a> Who entrusted to him the earth?
> And who put him over the whole world?
> <a name="18:34:14">34:14</a> If God were to set his heart on it,
> and gather in his spirit and his breath,
> <a name="18:34:15">34:15</a> all flesh would perish together
> and human beings would return to dust.

#### God Is Impartial and Omniscient

> <a name="18:34:16">34:16</a> “If you have understanding, listen to this,
> hear what I have to say.
> <a name="18:34:17">34:17</a> Do you really think
> that one who hates justice can govern?
> And will you declare guilty
> the supremely righteous One,
> <a name="18:34:18">34:18</a> who says to a king, ‘Worthless man’
> and to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’
> <a name="18:34:19">34:19</a> who shows no partiality to princes,
> and does not take note of the rich more than the poor,
> because all of them are the work of his hands?
> <a name="18:34:20">34:20</a> In a moment they die, in the middle of the night,
> people are shaken and they pass away.
> The mighty are removed effortlessly.
> <a name="18:34:21">34:21</a> For his eyes are on the ways of an individual,
> he observes all a person’s steps.
> <a name="18:34:22">34:22</a> There is no darkness, and no deep darkness,
> where evildoers can hide themselves.
> <a name="18:34:23">34:23</a> For he does not still consider a person,
> that he should come before God in judgment.
> <a name="18:34:24">34:24</a> He shatters the great without inquiry,
> and sets up others in their place.
> <a name="18:34:25">34:25</a> Therefore, he knows their deeds,
> he overthrows them in the night
> and they are crushed.
> <a name="18:34:26">34:26</a> He strikes them for their wickedness,
> in a place where people can see,
> <a name="18:34:27">34:27</a> because they have turned away from following him,
> and have not understood any of his ways,
> <a name="18:34:28">34:28</a> so that they caused the cry of the poor
> to come before him,
> so that he hears the cry of the needy.
> <a name="18:34:29">34:29</a> But if God is quiet, who can condemn him?
> If he hides his face, then who can see him?
> Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,
> <a name="18:34:30">34:30</a> so that the godless man should not rule,
> and not lay snares for the people.

#### Job Is Foolish to Rebel

> <a name="18:34:31">34:31</a> “Has anyone said to God,
> ‘I have endured chastisement,
> but I will not act wrongly any more.
> <a name="18:34:32">34:32</a> Teach me what I cannot see.
> If I have done evil, I will do so no more.’
> <a name="18:34:33">34:33</a> Is it your opinion that God should recompense it,
> because you reject this?
> But you must choose, and not I,
> so tell us what you know.
> <a name="18:34:34">34:34</a> Men of understanding say to me,
> any wise man listening to me says
> <a name="18:34:35">34:35</a> that Job speaks without knowledge
> and his words are without understanding.
> <a name="18:34:36">34:36</a> But Job will be tested to the end,
> because his answers are like those of wicked men.
> <a name="18:34:37">34:37</a> For he adds transgression to his sin;
> in our midst he claps his hands,
> and multiplies his words against God.”

### Chapter 35

#### Elihu’s Third Speech 

<a name="18:35:1">35:1</a> Then Elihu answered:

> <a name="18:35:2">35:2</a> “Do you think this to be just:
> when you say, ‘My right before God.’
> <a name="18:35:3">35:3</a> But you say, ‘What will it profit you,’
> and, ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’
> <a name="18:35:4">35:4</a> I will reply to you,
> and to your friends with you.
> <a name="18:35:5">35:5</a> Gaze at the heavens and see;
> consider the clouds, which are higher than you!
> <a name="18:35:6">35:6</a> If you sin, how does it affect God?
> If your transgressions are many,
> what does it do to him?
> <a name="18:35:7">35:7</a> If you are righteous, what do you give to God,
> or what does he receive from your hand?
> <a name="18:35:8">35:8</a> Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself,
> and your righteousness only other people.
> <a name="18:35:9">35:9</a> “People cry out
> because of the excess of oppression;
> they cry out for help
> because of the power of the mighty.
> <a name="18:35:10">35:10</a> But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator,
> who gives songs in the night,
> <a name="18:35:11">35:11</a> who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth,
> and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’
> <a name="18:35:12">35:12</a> Then they cry out—but he does not answer—
> because of the arrogance of the wicked.
> <a name="18:35:13">35:13</a> Surely it is an empty cry—God does not hear it;
> the Almighty does not take notice of it.
> <a name="18:35:14">35:14</a> How much less, then,
> when you say that you do not perceive him,
> that the case is before him
> and you are waiting for him!
> <a name="18:35:15">35:15</a> And further, when you say
> that his anger does not punish,
> and that he does not know transgression!
> <a name="18:35:16">35:16</a> So Job opens his mouth to no purpose;
> without knowledge he multiplies words.”

### Chapter 36

#### Elihu’s Fourth Speech 

<a name="18:36:1">36:1</a> Elihu said further:

> <a name="18:36:2">36:2</a> “Be patient with me a little longer
> and I will instruct you,
> for I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.
> <a name="18:36:3">36:3</a> With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively,
> and to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.
> <a name="18:36:4">36:4</a> For in truth, my words are not false;
> it is one complete in knowledge
> who is with you.
> <a name="18:36:5">36:5</a> Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people,
> he is mighty, and firm in his intent.
> <a name="18:36:6">36:6</a> He does not allow the wicked to live,
> but he gives justice to the poor.
> <a name="18:36:7">36:7</a> He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
> but with kings on the throne
> he seats the righteous and exalts them forever.
> <a name="18:36:8">36:8</a> But if they are bound in chains,
> and held captive by the cords of affliction,
> <a name="18:36:9">36:9</a> then he reveals to them what they have done,
> and their transgressions,
> that they were dealing proudly.
> <a name="18:36:10">36:10</a> And he reveals this for correction,
> and says that they must turn from evil.
> <a name="18:36:11">36:11</a> If they obey and serve him,
> they live out their days in prosperity
> and their years in pleasantness.
> <a name="18:36:12">36:12</a> But if they refuse to listen,
> they pass over the river of death,
> and expire without knowledge.
> <a name="18:36:13">36:13</a> The godless at heart nourish anger,
> they do not cry out even when he binds them.
> <a name="18:36:14">36:14</a> They die in their youth,
> and their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.
> <a name="18:36:15">36:15</a> He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions,
> he reveals himself to them by their suffering.
> <a name="18:36:16">36:16</a> And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress,
> to a wide place, unrestricted,
> and to the comfort of your table
> filled with rich food.
> <a name="18:36:17">36:17</a> But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked,
> judgment and justice take hold of you.
> <a name="18:36:18">36:18</a> Be careful that no one entices you with riches;
> do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
> <a name="18:36:19">36:19</a> Would your wealth sustain you,
> so that you would not be in distress,
> even all your mighty efforts?
> <a name="18:36:20">36:20</a> Do not long for the cover of night
> to drag people away from their homes.
> <a name="18:36:21">36:21</a> Take heed, do not turn to evil,
> for because of this you have been tested by affliction.
> <a name="18:36:22">36:22</a> Indeed, God is exalted in his power;
> who is a teacher like him?
> <a name="18:36:23">36:23</a> Who has prescribed his ways for him?
> Or said to him, ‘You have done what is wicked’?
> <a name="18:36:24">36:24</a> Remember to extol his work,
> which people have praised in song.
> <a name="18:36:25">36:25</a> All humanity has seen it;
> people gaze on it from afar.

#### The Work and Wisdom of God

> <a name="18:36:26">36:26</a> “Yes, God is great—beyond our knowledge!
> The number of his years is unsearchable.
> <a name="18:36:27">36:27</a> He draws up drops of water;
> they distill the rain into its mist,
> <a name="18:36:28">36:28</a> which the clouds pour down
> and shower on mankind abundantly.
> <a name="18:36:29">36:29</a> Who can understand the spreading of the clouds,
> the thunderings of his pavilion?
> <a name="18:36:30">36:30</a> See how he scattered his lightning about him;
> he has covered the depths of the sea.
> <a name="18:36:31">36:31</a> It is by these that he judges the nations
> and supplies food in abundance.
> <a name="18:36:32">36:32</a> With his hands he covers the lightning,
> and directs it against its target.
> <a name="18:36:33">36:33</a> His thunder announces the coming storm,
> the cattle also, concerning the storm’s approach.

### Chapter 37

> <a name="18:37:1">37:1</a> At this also my heart pounds
> and leaps from its place.
> <a name="18:37:2">37:2</a> Listen carefully to the thunder of his voice,

> <a name="18:37:3">37:3</a> Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
> even his lightning to the far corners of the earth.
> <a name="18:37:4">37:4</a> After that a voice roars;

> <a name="18:37:5">37:5</a> God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways;

> <a name="18:37:6">37:6</a> For to the snow he says, ‘Fall to earth,’

> <a name="18:37:7">37:7</a> He causes everyone to stop working,

> <a name="18:37:9">37:9</a> A tempest blows out from its chamber,

> <a name="18:37:10">37:10</a> The breath of God produces ice,

> <a name="18:37:11">37:11</a> He loads the clouds with moisture;
> he scatters his lightning through the clouds.
> <a name="18:37:12">37:12</a> The clouds go round in circles,

> <a name="18:37:13">37:13</a> Whether it is for punishment for his land,

> <a name="18:37:14">37:14</a> “Pay attention to this, Job!

### Chapter 38

#### The Lord’s First Speech 

<a name="18:38:1">38:1</a> Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind:

> <a name="18:38:2">38:2</a> “Who is this who darkens counsel
> with words without knowledge?
> <a name="18:38:3">38:3</a> Get ready for a difficult task like a man;
> I will question you
> and you will inform me!

#### God’s questions to Job

> <a name="18:38:4">38:4</a> “Where were you
> when I laid the foundation of the earth?
> Tell me, if you possess understanding!
> <a name="18:38:5">38:5</a> Who set its measurements—if you know—
> or who stretched a measuring line across it?
> <a name="18:38:6">38:6</a> On what were its bases set,
> or who laid its cornerstone—
> <a name="18:38:7">38:7</a> when the morning stars sang in chorus,
> and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
> <a name="18:38:8">38:8</a> “Who shut up the sea with doors
> when it burst forth, coming out of the womb,
> <a name="18:38:9">38:9</a> when I made the storm clouds its garment,
> and thick darkness its swaddling band,
> <a name="18:38:10">38:10</a> when I prescribed its limits,
> and set in place its bars and doors,
> <a name="18:38:11">38:11</a> when I said, ‘To here you may come
> and no farther,
> here your proud waves will be confined’?
> <a name="18:38:12">38:12</a> Have you ever in your life commanded the morning,
> or made the dawn know its place,
> <a name="18:38:13">38:13</a> that it might seize the corners of the earth,
> and shake the wicked out of it?
> <a name="18:38:14">38:14</a> The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
> its features are dyed like a garment.
> <a name="18:38:15">38:15</a> Then from the wicked the light is withheld,
> and the raised arm in violence is broken.
> <a name="18:38:16">38:16</a> Have you gone to the springs that fill the sea,
> or walked about in the recesses of the deep?
> <a name="18:38:17">38:17</a> Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
> Have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
> <a name="18:38:18">38:18</a> Have you considered the vast expanses of the earth?
> Tell me, if you know it all!
> <a name="18:38:19">38:19</a> “In what direction does light reside,

> <a name="18:38:22">38:22</a> Have you entered the storehouse of the snow,
> or seen the armory of the hail,
> <a name="18:38:23">38:23</a> which I reserve for the time of trouble,
> for the day of war and battle?
> <a name="18:38:24">38:24</a> In what direction is lightning dispersed,
> or the east winds scattered over the earth?
> <a name="18:38:25">38:25</a> Who carves out a channel for the heavy rains,
> and a path for the rumble of thunder,
> <a name="18:38:26">38:26</a> to cause it to rain on an uninhabited land,
> a desert where there are no human beings,
> <a name="18:38:27">38:27</a> to satisfy a devastated and desolate land,
> and to cause it to sprout with vegetation?
> <a name="18:38:28">38:28</a> Does the rain have a father,
> or who has fathered the drops of the dew?
> <a name="18:38:29">38:29</a> From whose womb does the ice emerge,

> <a name="18:38:30">38:30</a> when the waters become hard like stone,
> when the surface of the deep is frozen solid?
> <a name="18:38:31">38:31</a> Can you tie the bands of the Pleiades,

> or guide the Bear with its cubs?
> <a name="18:38:33">38:33</a> Do you know the laws of the heavens,
> or can you set up their rule over the earth?
> <a name="18:38:34">38:34</a> Can you raise your voice to the clouds
> so that a flood of water covers you?
> <a name="18:38:35">38:35</a> Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go?
> Will they say to you, ‘Here we are’?
> <a name="18:38:36">38:36</a> Who has put wisdom in the heart,
> or has imparted understanding to the mind?
> <a name="18:38:37">38:37</a> Who by wisdom can count the clouds,
> and who can tip over the water jars of heaven,
> <a name="18:38:38">38:38</a> when the dust hardens into a mass,
> and the clumps of earth stick together?
> <a name="18:38:39">38:39</a> “Do you hunt prey for the lioness,
> and satisfy the appetite of the lions,
> <a name="18:38:40">38:40</a> when they crouch in their dens,
> when they wait in ambush in the thicket?
> <a name="18:38:41">38:41</a> Who prepares prey for the raven,
> when its young cry out to God
> and wander about for lack of food?

### Chapter 39

> <a name="18:39:1">39:1</a> “Are you acquainted with the way

> <a name="18:39:3">39:3</a> They crouch, they bear their young,

### Chapter 40

#### Job’s Reply to God’s Challenge 

<a name="18:40:1">40:1</a> Then the Lord answered Job:

> <a name="18:40:2">40:2</a> “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
> Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!”
> <a name="18:40:3">40:3</a> Then Job answered the Lord:
> <a name="18:40:4">40:4</a> “Indeed, I am completely unworthy—how could I reply to you?
> I put my hand over my mouth to silence myself.
> <a name="18:40:5">40:5</a> I have spoken once, but I cannot answer;
> twice, but I will say no more.”

#### The Lord’s Second Speech

<a name="18:40:6">40:6</a> Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind:

> <a name="18:40:7">40:7</a> “Get ready for a difficult task like a man.
> I will question you and you will inform me!
> <a name="18:40:8">40:8</a> Would you indeed annul my justice?
> Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right?
> <a name="18:40:9">40:9</a> Do you have an arm like God’s,
> and can you thunder with a voice like his?
> <a name="18:40:10">40:10</a> Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency,

### Chapter 42

#### Job’s Confession 

<a name="18:42:1">42:1</a> Then Job answered the Lord:

> <a name="18:42:2">42:2</a> “I know that you can do all things;
> no purpose of yours can be thwarted;
> <a name="18:42:3">42:3</a> you asked,
> ‘Who is this who darkens counsel
> without knowledge?’
> But I have declared without understanding
> things too wonderful for me to know.
> <a name="18:42:4">42:4</a> You said,
> ‘Pay attention, and I will speak;
> I will question you, and you will answer me.’
> <a name="18:42:5">42:5</a> I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
> but now my eye has seen you.
> <a name="18:42:6">42:6</a> Therefore I despise myself,
> and I repent in dust and ashes!

## VII. The Epilogue (<a name="18:42:7">42:7</a>-17)

<a name="18:42:7">42:7</a> After the Lord had spoken these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My anger is stirred up against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has. <a name="18:42:8">42:8</a> So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will intercede for you, and I will respect him, so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.”

<a name="18:42:9">42:9</a> So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the Lord had told them; and the Lord had respect for Job.

<a name="18:42:10">42:10</a> So the Lord restored what Job had lost after he prayed for his friends, and the Lord doubled all that had belonged to Job. <a name="18:42:11">42:11</a> So they came to him, all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him and consoled him for all the trouble the Lord had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.

<a name="18:42:12">42:12</a> So the Lord blessed the second part of Job’s life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. <a name="18:42:13">42:13</a> And he also had seven sons and three daughters. <a name="18:42:14">42:14</a> The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-Happuch. <a name="18:42:15">42:15</a> Nowhere in all the land could women be found who were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance alongside their brothers.

<a name="18:42:16">42:16</a> After this Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. <a name="18:42:17">42:17</a> And so Job died, old and full of days.
