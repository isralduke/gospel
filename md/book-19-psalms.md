## Book 1 (Psalm 1–41)

### Psalm 1

> <a name="19:1:1">1:1</a> How happy is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,
> or stand in the pathway with sinners,
> or sit in the assembly of arrogant fools!
> <a name="19:1:2">1:2</a> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lord’s commands;
> he intently studies his commands day and night.
> <a name="19:1:3">1:3</a> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;
> it yields its fruit at the proper time,
> and its leaves never fall off.
> He succeeds in everything he attempts.
> <a name="19:1:4">1:4</a> Not so with the wicked!
> Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
> <a name="19:1:5">1:5</a> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,
> nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
> <a name="19:1:6">1:6</a> Certainly the Lord rewards the behavior of the godly,
> but the behavior of the wicked is self-destructive.

> against the Lord and his chosen king.
> <a name="19:2:3">2:3</a> They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us!
> Let’s free ourselves from their ropes!”
> <a name="19:2:4">2:4</a> The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;
> the sovereign Master taunts them.
> <a name="19:2:5">2:5</a> Then he angrily speaks to them
> and terrifies them in his rage.
> <a name="19:2:6">2:6</a> He says, “I myself have installed my king
> on Zion, my holy hill.”
> <a name="19:2:7">2:7</a> The king says, “I will tell you what the Lord decreed. He said to me:
> ‘You are my son! This very day I have become your father!
> <a name="19:2:8">2:8</a> You have only to ask me,
> and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
> the ends of the earth as your personal property.
> <a name="19:2:9">2:9</a> You will break them with an iron scepter;
> you will smash them as if they were a potter’s jar.’”
> <a name="19:2:10">2:10</a> So now, you kings, do what is wise!
> You rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
> <a name="19:2:11">2:11</a> Serve the Lord in fear!
> Repent in terror!
> <a name="19:2:12">2:12</a> Give sincere homage!

> when his anger quickly ignites.
> How happy are all who take shelter in him!

### Psalm 18

For the music director; by the Lord’s servant David, who sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord rescued him from the power of all his enemies, including Saul.

> <a name="19:18:1">18:1</a> He said:
> “I love you, Lord, my source of strength!
> <a name="19:18:2">18:2</a> The Lord is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer.
> My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter,
> my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge.
> <a name="19:18:3">18:3</a> I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
> and I was delivered from my enemies.
> <a name="19:18:4">18:4</a> The waves of death engulfed me,
> the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
> <a name="19:18:5">18:5</a> The ropes of Sheol tightened around me,
> the snares of death trapped me.
> <a name="19:18:6">18:6</a> In my distress I called to the Lord;
> I cried out to my God.
> From his heavenly temple he heard my voice;
> he listened to my cry for help.
> <a name="19:18:7">18:7</a> The earth heaved and shook;
> the roots of the mountains trembled;
> they heaved because he was angry.
> <a name="19:18:8">18:8</a> Smoke ascended from his nose;
> fire devoured as it came from his mouth;
> he hurled down fiery coals.
> <a name="19:18:9">18:9</a> He made the sky sink as he descended;
> a thick cloud was under his feet.
> <a name="19:18:10">18:10</a> He mounted a winged angel and flew;
> he glided on the wings of the wind.
> <a name="19:18:11">18:11</a> He shrouded himself in darkness,
> in thick rain clouds.
> <a name="19:18:12">18:12</a> From the brightness in front of him came
> hail and fiery coals.
> <a name="19:18:13">18:13</a> The Lord thundered in the sky;
> the Sovereign One shouted.
> <a name="19:18:14">18:14</a> He shot his arrows and scattered them,
> many lightning bolts and routed them.
> <a name="19:18:15">18:15</a> The depths of the sea were exposed;
> the inner regions of the world were uncovered
> by your battle cry, Lord,
> by the powerful breath from your nose.
> <a name="19:18:16">18:16</a> He reached down from above and grabbed me;
> he pulled me from the surging water.
> <a name="19:18:17">18:17</a> He rescued me from my strong enemy,
> from those who hate me,
> for they were too strong for me.
> <a name="19:18:18">18:18</a> They confronted me in my day of calamity,
> but the Lord helped me.
> <a name="19:18:19">18:19</a> He brought me out into a wide open place;
> he delivered me because he was pleased with me.
> <a name="19:18:20">18:20</a> The Lord repaid me for my godly deeds;
> he rewarded my blameless behavior.
> <a name="19:18:21">18:21</a> For I have obeyed the Lord’s commands;
> I have not rebelled against my God.
> <a name="19:18:22">18:22</a> For I am aware of all his regulations,
> and I do not reject his rules.
> <a name="19:18:23">18:23</a> I was innocent before him,
> and kept myself from sinning.
> <a name="19:18:24">18:24</a> The Lord rewarded me for my godly deeds;
> he took notice of my blameless behavior.
> <a name="19:18:25">18:25</a> You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful;
> you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent.
> <a name="19:18:26">18:26</a> You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless,
> but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse.
> <a name="19:18:27">18:27</a> For you deliver oppressed people,
> but you bring down those who have a proud look.
> <a name="19:18:28">18:28</a> Indeed, you are my lamp, Lord.
> My God illuminates the darkness around me.
> <a name="19:18:29">18:29</a> Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army;
> by my God’s power I can jump over a wall.
> <a name="19:18:30">18:30</a> The one true God acts in a faithful manner;
> the Lord’s promise is reliable;
> he is a shield to all who take shelter in him.
> <a name="19:18:31">18:31</a> Indeed, who is God besides the Lord?
> Who is a protector besides our God?
> <a name="19:18:32">18:32</a> The one true God gives me strength;
> he removes the obstacles in my way.
> <a name="19:18:33">18:33</a> He gives me the agility of a deer;
> he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
> <a name="19:18:34">18:34</a> He trains my hands for battle;
> my arms can bend even the strongest bow.
> <a name="19:18:35">18:35</a> You give me your protective shield;
> your right hand supports me;
> your willingness to help enables me to prevail.
> <a name="19:18:36">18:36</a> You widen my path;
> my feet do not slip.
> <a name="19:18:37">18:37</a> I chase my enemies and catch them;
> I do not turn back until I wipe them out.
> <a name="19:18:38">18:38</a> I beat them to death;
> they fall at my feet.
> <a name="19:18:39">18:39</a> You give me strength for battle;
> you make my foes kneel before me.
> <a name="19:18:40">18:40</a> You make my enemies retreat;
> I destroy those who hate me.
> <a name="19:18:41">18:41</a> They cry out, but there is no one to help them;
> they cry out to the Lord, but he does not answer them.
> <a name="19:18:42">18:42</a> I grind them as fine windblown dust;
> I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets.
> <a name="19:18:43">18:43</a> You rescue me from a hostile army;
> you make me a leader of nations;
> people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects.
> <a name="19:18:44">18:44</a> When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me.
> Foreigners are powerless before me;
> <a name="19:18:45">18:45</a> foreigners lose their courage;
> they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.
> <a name="19:18:46">18:46</a> The Lord is alive!
> My protector is praiseworthy!
> The God who delivers me is exalted as king!
> <a name="19:18:47">18:47</a> The one true God completely vindicates me;
> he makes nations submit to me.
> <a name="19:18:48">18:48</a> He delivers me from my enemies;
> you snatch me away from those who attack me;
> you rescue me from violent men.
> <a name="19:18:49">18:49</a> So I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord!
> I will sing praises to you!
> <a name="19:18:50">18:50</a> He gives his chosen king magnificent victories;

> <a name="19:19:3">19:3</a> There is no actual speech or word,

> <a name="19:36:1">36:1</a> An evil man is rebellious to the core.
> He does not fear God,
> <a name="19:36:2">36:2</a> for he is too proud
> to recognize and give up his sin.
> <a name="19:36:3">36:3</a> The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
> he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
> <a name="19:36:4">36:4</a> He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed;
> he is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
> he does not reject what is evil.
> <a name="19:36:5">36:5</a> O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky;
> your faithfulness to the clouds.
> <a name="19:36:6">36:6</a> Your justice is like the highest mountains,

### Psalm 39

For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David.

> <a name="19:39:1">39:1</a> I decided, “I will watch what I say

> I will put a muzzle over my mouth
> while in the presence of an evil man.”
> <a name="19:39:2">39:2</a> I was stone silent;
> I held back the urge to speak.
> My frustration grew;
> <a name="19:39:3">39:3</a> my anxiety intensified.
> As I thought about it, I became impatient.
> Finally I spoke these words:
> <a name="19:39:4">39:4</a> “O Lord, help me understand my mortality
> and the brevity of life!
> Let me realize how quickly my life will pass!
> <a name="19:39:5">39:5</a> Look, you make my days short-lived,
> and my life span is nothing from your perspective.
> Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor.
> <a name="19:39:6">39:6</a> Surely people go through life as mere ghosts.
> Surely they accumulate worthless wealth
> without knowing who will eventually haul it away.”
> <a name="19:39:7">39:7</a> But now, O sovereign Master, upon what am I relying?
> You are my only hope!
> <a name="19:39:8">39:8</a> Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion!

> <a name="19:39:10">39:10</a> Please stop wounding me!

> <a name="19:39:11">39:11</a> You severely discipline people for their sins;
> like a moth you slowly devour their strength.
> Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)
> <a name="19:39:12">39:12</a> Hear my prayer, O Lord!
> Listen to my cry for help!
> Do not ignore my sobbing!
> For I am dependent on you, like one residing outside his native land;

> <a name="19:39:13">39:13</a> Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy

> <a name="19:49:7">49:7</a> Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother;

> God comes in splendor.
> <a name="19:50:3">50:3</a> Our God approaches and is not silent;
> consuming fire goes ahead of him
> and all around him a storm rages.
> <a name="19:50:4">50:4</a> He summons the heavens above,
> as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.
> <a name="19:50:5">50:5</a> He says:
> “Assemble my covenant people before me,
> those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
> <a name="19:50:6">50:6</a> The heavens declare his fairness,
> for God is judge. (Selah)
> <a name="19:50:7">50:7</a> He says:
> “Listen my people! I am speaking!
> Listen Israel! I am accusing you!
> I am God, your God!
> <a name="19:50:8">50:8</a> I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices,

> or goats from your sheepfolds.
> <a name="19:50:10">50:10</a> For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me,
> as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.
> <a name="19:50:11">50:11</a> I keep track of every bird in the hills,
> and the insects of the field are mine.

> <a name="19:50:13">50:13</a> Do I eat the flesh of bulls?
> Do I drink the blood of goats?
> <a name="19:50:14">50:14</a> Present to God a thank-offering!
> Repay your vows to the Sovereign One!
> <a name="19:50:15">50:15</a> Pray to me when you are in trouble!
> I will deliver you and vindicate you!”
> <a name="19:50:16">50:16</a> God says this to the evildoer:
> “How can you declare my commands,
> and talk about my covenant?
> <a name="19:50:17">50:17</a> For you hate instruction
> and reject my words.
> <a name="19:50:18">50:18</a> When you see a thief, you join him;
> you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.
> <a name="19:50:19">50:19</a> You do damage with words,
> and use your tongue to deceive.
> <a name="19:50:20">50:20</a> You plot against your brother;
> you slander your own brother.
> <a name="19:50:21">50:21</a> When you did these things, I was silent,
> so you thought I was exactly like you.
> But now I will condemn you
> and state my case against you!
> <a name="19:50:22">50:22</a> Carefully consider this, you who reject God!
> Otherwise I will rip you to shreds
> and no one will be able to rescue you.
> <a name="19:50:23">50:23</a> Whoever presents a thank-offering honors me.
> To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver.”

> <a name="19:51:2">51:2</a> Scrub away my wrongdoing!
> Cleanse me of my sin!
> <a name="19:51:3">51:3</a> For I am aware of my rebellious acts;
> I am forever conscious of my sin.
> <a name="19:51:4">51:4</a> Against you, especially you, I have sinned;
> I have done what is sinful in your sight.
> So you are just when you confront me;
> you are right when you condemn me.
> <a name="19:51:5">51:5</a> Look, I was prone to do wrong from birth;
> I was a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
> <a name="19:51:6">51:6</a> Look, you desire integrity in the inner man;
> you want me to possess wisdom.
> <a name="19:51:7">51:7</a> Sprinkle me with water and I will be pure;
> wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
> <a name="19:51:8">51:8</a> Give me the ecstatic joy of being forgiven!

> and sinners will turn to you.
> <a name="19:51:14">51:14</a> Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me!
> Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your deliverance.
> <a name="19:51:15">51:15</a> O sovereign Master, give me reason to celebrate!
> Then my mouth will praise you.
> <a name="19:51:16">51:16</a> Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it;
> you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
> <a name="19:51:17">51:17</a> The “sacrifices” God desires are a humble attitude—
> O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.
> <a name="19:51:18">51:18</a> Be favorably disposed to Zion!
> Build the walls of Jerusalem!
> <a name="19:51:19">51:19</a> Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings;
> then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.

> God’s loyal love protects me all day long!
> <a name="19:52:2">52:2</a> Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;
> it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.
> <a name="19:52:3">52:3</a> You love evil more than good,
> lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)
> <a name="19:52:4">52:4</a> You love to use all the words that destroy,
> and the tongue that deceives.
> <a name="19:52:5">52:5</a> Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins.
> He will scoop you up and remove you from your home;
> he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)
> <a name="19:52:6">52:6</a> When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe,
> and will mock the evildoer, saying:
> <a name="19:52:7">52:7</a> “Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector!
> He trusted in his great wealth
> and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”
> <a name="19:52:8">52:8</a> But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God;

> and do not call out to God.
> <a name="19:53:5">53:5</a> They are absolutely terrified,
> even by things that do not normally cause fear.
> For God annihilates those who attack you.
> You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.
> <a name="19:53:6">53:6</a> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!
> When God restores the well-being of his people,

### Psalm 69

For the music director; according to the tune of “Lilies;” by David.

> <a name="19:69:1">69:1</a> Deliver me, O God,
> for the water has reached my neck.
> <a name="19:69:2">69:2</a> I sink into the deep mire
> where there is no solid ground;
> I am in deep water,
> and the current overpowers me.
> <a name="19:69:3">69:3</a> I am exhausted from shouting for help;
> my throat is sore;
> my eyes grow tired of looking for my God.
> <a name="19:69:4">69:4</a> Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head.
> Those who want to destroy me and are my enemies for no reason outnumber me.
> They make me “pay back” what I did not steal!
> <a name="19:69:5">69:5</a> O God, you are aware of my foolish sins;

> <a name="19:69:6">69:6</a> Let none who rely on you be embarrassed because of me,
> O sovereign Lord and king!
> Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me,
> O God of Israel!
> <a name="19:69:7">69:7</a> For I suffer humiliation for your sake
> and am thoroughly disgraced.
> <a name="19:69:8">69:8</a> My own brothers treat me like a stranger;
> they act as if I were a foreigner.
> <a name="19:69:9">69:9</a> Certainly devotion to your temple consumes me;
> I endure the insults of those who insult you.
> <a name="19:69:10">69:10</a> I weep and refrain from eating food,

> <a name="19:69:11">69:11</a> I wear sackcloth

> <a name="19:69:12">69:12</a> Those who sit at the city gate talk about me;
> drunkards mock me in their songs.
> <a name="19:69:13">69:13</a> O Lord, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me!
> O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me;

> you can see all my enemies.
> <a name="19:69:20">69:20</a> Their insults are painful and make me lose heart;
> I look for sympathy, but receive none,
> for comforters, but find none.
> <a name="19:69:21">69:21</a> They put a poisonous herb into my food,
> and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
> <a name="19:69:22">69:22</a> May their dining table become a trap before them!
> May it be a snare for that group of friends!
> <a name="19:69:23">69:23</a> May their eyes be blinded!

> <a name="19:69:24">69:24</a> Pour out your judgment on them!

> <a name="19:69:25">69:25</a> May their camp become desolate!
> May no one be left alive in their tents!
> <a name="19:69:26">69:26</a> For they harass the one whom you discipline;

> <a name="19:69:27">69:27</a> Hold them accountable for all their sins!
> Do not vindicate them!
> <a name="19:69:28">69:28</a> May their names be wiped out of the scroll listing the living!
> Do not let their names be listed with the godly!
> <a name="19:69:29">69:29</a> I am oppressed and suffering!
> O God, deliver and protect me!
> <a name="19:69:30">69:30</a> I will sing praises to God’s name!

### Psalm 73

A psalm by Asaph.

> <a name="19:73:1">73:1</a> Certainly God is good to Israel,
> and to those whose motives are pure!
> <a name="19:73:2">73:2</a> But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
> my feet almost slid out from under me.
> <a name="19:73:3">73:3</a> For I envied those who are proud,
> as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.
> <a name="19:73:4">73:4</a> For they suffer no pain;
> their bodies are strong and well-fed.
> <a name="19:73:5">73:5</a> They are immune to the trouble common to men;
> they do not suffer as other men do.
> <a name="19:73:6">73:6</a> Arrogance is their necklace,
> and violence their clothing.
> <a name="19:73:7">73:7</a> Their prosperity causes them to do wrong;
> their thoughts are sinful.
> <a name="19:73:8">73:8</a> They mock and say evil things;
> they proudly threaten violence.
> <a name="19:73:9">73:9</a> They speak as if they rule in heaven,
> and lay claim to the earth.
> <a name="19:73:10">73:10</a> Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,
> and even suck up the water of the sea.
> <a name="19:73:11">73:11</a> They say, “How does God know what we do?
> Is the sovereign one aware of what goes on?”
> <a name="19:73:12">73:12</a> Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like,
> those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
> <a name="19:73:13">73:13</a> I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure
> and maintained a pure lifestyle.
> <a name="19:73:14">73:14</a> I suffer all day long,
> and am punished every morning.”
> <a name="19:73:15">73:15</a> If I had publicized these thoughts,
> I would have betrayed your loyal followers.
> <a name="19:73:16">73:16</a> When I tried to make sense of this,
> it was troubling to me.
> <a name="19:73:17">73:17</a> Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple,
> and understood the destiny of the wicked.
> <a name="19:73:18">73:18</a> Surely you put them in slippery places;
> you bring them down to ruin.
> <a name="19:73:19">73:19</a> How desolate they become in a mere moment!
> Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
> <a name="19:73:20">73:20</a> They are like a dream after one wakes up.
> O sovereign Master, when you awake you will despise them.
> <a name="19:73:21">73:21</a> Yes, my spirit was bitter,
> and my insides felt sharp pain.
> <a name="19:73:22">73:22</a> I was ignorant and lacked insight;
> I was as senseless as an animal before you.
> <a name="19:73:23">73:23</a> But I am continually with you;
> you hold my right hand.
> <a name="19:73:24">73:24</a> You guide me by your wise advice,
> and then you will lead me to a position of honor.
> <a name="19:73:25">73:25</a> Whom do I have in heaven but you?
> I desire no one but you on earth.
> <a name="19:73:26">73:26</a> My flesh and my heart may grow weak,
> but God always protects my heart and gives me stability.
> <a name="19:73:27">73:27</a> Yes, look! Those far from you die;
> you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
> <a name="19:73:28">73:28</a> But as for me, God’s presence is all I need.
> I have made the sovereign Lord my shelter,
> as I declare all the things you have done.

### Psalm 74

A well-written song by Asaph.

> <a name="19:74:1">74:1</a> Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us?
> Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
> <a name="19:74:2">74:2</a> Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times,
> whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation,
> as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
> <a name="19:74:3">74:3</a> Hurry and look at the permanent ruins,
> and all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!
> <a name="19:74:4">74:4</a> Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary;
> they set up their battle flags.
> <a name="19:74:5">74:5</a> They invade like lumberjacks
> swinging their axes in a thick forest.
> <a name="19:74:6">74:6</a> And now they are tearing down all its engravings
> with axes and crowbars.
> <a name="19:74:7">74:7</a> They set your sanctuary on fire;
> they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
> <a name="19:74:8">74:8</a> They say to themselves,
> “We will oppress all of them.”
> They burn down all the places where people worship God in the land.
> <a name="19:74:9">74:9</a> We do not see any signs of God’s presence;
> there are no longer any prophets
> and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.
> <a name="19:74:10">74:10</a> How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults?
> Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
> <a name="19:74:11">74:11</a> Why do you remain inactive?
> Intervene and destroy him!
> <a name="19:74:12">74:12</a> But God has been my king from ancient times,
> performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
> <a name="19:74:13">74:13</a> You destroyed the sea by your strength;
> you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.
> <a name="19:74:14">74:14</a> You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
> you fed him to the people who live along the coast.
> <a name="19:74:15">74:15</a> You broke open the spring and the stream;
> you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
> <a name="19:74:16">74:16</a> You established the cycle of day and night;
> you put the moon and sun in place.
> <a name="19:74:17">74:17</a> You set up all the boundaries of the earth;
> you created the cycle of summer and winter.
> <a name="19:74:18">74:18</a> Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O Lord,
> and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
> <a name="19:74:19">74:19</a> Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal!
> Do not continue to disregard the lives of your oppressed people!
> <a name="19:74:20">74:20</a> Remember your covenant promises,

> <a name="19:74:21">74:21</a> Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame!
> Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
> <a name="19:74:22">74:22</a> Rise up, O God! Defend your honor!
> Remember how fools insult you all day long!
> <a name="19:74:23">74:23</a> Do not disregard what your enemies say,

For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song.

> <a name="19:76:1">76:1</a> God has revealed himself in Judah;
> in Israel his reputation is great.
> <a name="19:76:2">76:2</a> He lives in Salem;
> he dwells in Zion.
> <a name="19:76:3">76:3</a> There he shattered the arrows,
> the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)
> <a name="19:76:4">76:4</a> You shine brightly and reveal your majesty,
> as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
> <a name="19:76:5">76:5</a> The bravehearted were plundered;
> they “fell asleep.”
> All the warriors were helpless.
> <a name="19:76:6">76:6</a> At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob,
> both rider and horse “fell asleep.”
> <a name="19:76:7">76:7</a> You are awesome! Yes, you!
> Who can withstand your intense anger?
> <a name="19:76:8">76:8</a> From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.
> The earth was afraid and silent
> <a name="19:76:9">76:9</a> when God arose to execute judgment,
> and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
> <a name="19:76:10">76:10</a> Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise;
> you reveal your anger in full measure.
> <a name="19:76:11">76:11</a> Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them!
> Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!
> <a name="19:76:12">76:12</a> He humbles princes;
> the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.

### Psalm 77

For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph.

> <a name="19:77:1">77:1</a> I will cry out to God and call for help!
> I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me.
> <a name="19:77:2">77:2</a> In my time of trouble I sought the sovereign Master.
> I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night.
> I refused to be comforted.
> <a name="19:77:3">77:3</a> I said, “I will remember God while I groan;
> I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)
> <a name="19:77:4">77:4</a> You held my eyelids open;
> I was troubled and could not speak.
> <a name="19:77:5">77:5</a> I thought about the days of old,
> about ancient times.
> <a name="19:77:6">77:6</a> I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang;
> I will think very carefully.”
> I tried to make sense of what was happening.
> <a name="19:77:7">77:7</a> I asked, “Will the sovereign Master reject me forever?
> Will he never again show me his favor?
> <a name="19:77:8">77:8</a> Has his loyal love disappeared forever?
> Has his promise failed forever?
> <a name="19:77:9">77:9</a> Has God forgotten to be merciful?
> Has his anger stifled his compassion?”
> <a name="19:77:10">77:10</a> Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought

> <a name="19:77:11">77:11</a> I will remember the works of the Lord.
> Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago!

> <a name="19:77:13">77:13</a> O God, your deeds are extraordinary!
> What god can compare to our great God?
> <a name="19:77:14">77:14</a> You are the God who does amazing things;
> you have revealed your strength among the nations.
> <a name="19:77:15">77:15</a> You delivered your people by your strength—
> the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
> <a name="19:77:16">77:16</a> The waters saw you, O God,
> the waters saw you and trembled.
> Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.
> <a name="19:77:17">77:17</a> The clouds poured down rain;
> the skies thundered.
> Yes, your arrows flashed about.
> <a name="19:77:18">77:18</a> Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind;
> the lightning bolts lit up the world;
> the earth trembled and shook.
> <a name="19:77:19">77:19</a> You walked through the sea;
> you passed through the surging waters,
> but left no footprints.
> <a name="19:77:20">77:20</a> You led your people like a flock of sheep,
> by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

> We will tell the next generation
> about the Lord’s praiseworthy acts,
> about his strength and the amazing things he has done.
> <a name="19:78:5">78:5</a> He established a rule in Jacob;
> he set up a law in Israel.
> He commanded our ancestors
> to make his deeds known to their descendants,
> <a name="19:78:6">78:6</a> so that the next generation, children yet to be born,
> might know about them.
> They will grow up and tell their descendants about them.
> <a name="19:78:7">78:7</a> Then they will place their confidence in God.
> They will not forget the works of God,
> and they will obey his commands.
> <a name="19:78:8">78:8</a> Then they will not be like their ancestors,
> who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,
> a generation that was not committed
> and faithful to God.
> <a name="19:78:9">78:9</a> The Ephraimites were armed with bows,
> but they retreated in the day of battle.
> <a name="19:78:10">78:10</a> They did not keep their covenant with God,

> <a name="19:78:12">78:12</a> He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors,
> in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
> <a name="19:78:13">78:13</a> He divided the sea and led them across it;
> he made the water stand in a heap.
> <a name="19:78:14">78:14</a> He led them with a cloud by day,
> and with the light of a fire all night long.
> <a name="19:78:15">78:15</a> He broke open rocks in the wilderness,
> and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.
> <a name="19:78:16">78:16</a> He caused streams to flow from the rock,
> and made the water flow like rivers.
> <a name="19:78:17">78:17</a> Yet they continued to sin against him,
> and rebelled against the Sovereign One in the desert.
> <a name="19:78:18">78:18</a> They willfully challenged God
> by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.
> <a name="19:78:19">78:19</a> They insulted God, saying,
> “Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness?
> <a name="19:78:20">78:20</a> Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out,
> streams gushed forth.
> But can he also give us food?
> Will he provide meat for his people?”
> <a name="19:78:21">78:21</a> When the Lord heard this, he was furious.
> A fire broke out against Jacob,
> and his anger flared up against Israel,
> <a name="19:78:22">78:22</a> because they did not have faith in God,
> and did not trust his ability to deliver them.
> <a name="19:78:23">78:23</a> He gave a command to the clouds above,
> and opened the doors in the sky.
> <a name="19:78:24">78:24</a> He rained down manna for them to eat;
> he gave them the grain of heaven.
> <a name="19:78:25">78:25</a> Man ate the food of the mighty ones.
> He sent them more than enough to eat.
> <a name="19:78:26">78:26</a> He brought the east wind through the sky,
> and by his strength led forth the south wind.
> <a name="19:78:27">78:27</a> He rained down meat on them like dust,
> birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.
> <a name="19:78:28">78:28</a> He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp,
> all around their homes.
> <a name="19:78:29">78:29</a> They ate until they were stuffed;
> he gave them what they desired.
> <a name="19:78:30">78:30</a> They were not yet filled up,

> <a name="19:78:31">78:31</a> when the anger of God flared up against them.
> He killed some of the strongest of them;

> <a name="19:78:32">78:32</a> Despite all this, they continued to sin,
> and did not trust him to do amazing things.
> <a name="19:78:33">78:33</a> So he caused them to die unsatisfied

> <a name="19:78:34">78:34</a> When he struck them down, they sought his favor;
> they turned back and longed for God.
> <a name="19:78:35">78:35</a> They remembered that God was their protector,
> and that the sovereign God was their deliverer.
> <a name="19:78:36">78:36</a> But they deceived him with their words,
> and lied to him.
> <a name="19:78:37">78:37</a> They were not really committed to him,
> and they were unfaithful to his covenant.
> <a name="19:78:38">78:38</a> Yet he is compassionate.
> He forgives sin and does not destroy.
> He often holds back his anger,
> and does not stir up his fury.
> <a name="19:78:39">78:39</a> He remembered that they were made of flesh,
> and were like a wind that blows past and does not return.
> <a name="19:78:40">78:40</a> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
> and insulted him in the desert!
> <a name="19:78:41">78:41</a> They again challenged God,

> <a name="19:78:42">78:42</a> They did not remember what he had done,

> <a name="19:78:46">78:46</a> He gave their crops to the grasshopper,
> the fruit of their labor to the locust.
> <a name="19:78:47">78:47</a> He destroyed their vines with hail,

> <a name="19:78:48">78:48</a> He rained hail down on their cattle,
> and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock.
> <a name="19:78:49">78:49</a> His raging anger lashed out against them,
> He sent fury, rage, and trouble
> as messengers who bring disaster.
> <a name="19:78:50">78:50</a> He sent his anger in full force;
> he did not spare them from death;

> <a name="19:78:51">78:51</a> He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,

> <a name="19:78:54">78:54</a> He brought them to the border of his holy land,

> <a name="19:78:56">78:56</a> Yet they challenged and defied the Sovereign God,

> <a name="19:78:57">78:57</a> They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors;

> <a name="19:78:58">78:58</a> They made him angry with their pagan shrines,

> <a name="19:78:59">78:59</a> God heard and was angry;

> <a name="19:78:60">78:60</a> He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh,

> <a name="19:109:4">109:4</a> They repay my love with accusations,

> May an accuser stand at his right side!
> <a name="19:109:7">109:7</a> When he is judged, he will be found guilty!

> <a name="19:109:17">109:17</a> He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him.
> He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
> <a name="19:109:18">109:18</a> He made cursing a way of life,
