# Proverbs

## Chapter 1

### Introduction to the Book

> <a name="20:1:1">1:1</a> The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
> <a name="20:1:2">1:2</a> To learn wisdom and moral instruction,
> and to discern wise counsel.
> <a name="20:1:3">1:3</a> To receive moral instruction in skillful living,
> in righteousness, justice, and equity.
> <a name="20:1:4">1:4</a> To impart shrewdness to the morally naive,
> and a discerning plan to the young person.
> <a name="20:1:5">1:5</a> (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction,
> and let the discerning acquire guidance!)
> <a name="20:1:6">1:6</a> To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable,
> the sayings of the wise and their riddles.

### Introduction to the Theme of the Book

> <a name="20:1:7">1:7</a> Fearing the Lord is the beginning of moral knowledge,
> but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
> <a name="20:1:8">1:8</a> Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,
> and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.
> <a name="20:1:9">1:9</a> For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,
> and like pendants around your neck.

### Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches

> <a name="20:1:10">1:10</a> My child, if sinners try to entice you,
> do not consent!
> <a name="20:1:11">1:11</a> If they say, “Come with us!
> We will lie in wait to shed blood;
> we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.
> <a name="20:1:12">1:12</a> We will swallow them alive like Sheol,
> those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.
> <a name="20:1:13">1:13</a> We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;
> we will fill our houses with plunder.
> <a name="20:1:14">1:14</a> Join with us!
> We will all share equally in what we steal.”
> <a name="20:1:15">1:15</a> My child, do not go down their way,
> withhold yourself from their path;
> <a name="20:1:16">1:16</a> for they are eager to inflict harm,
> and they hasten to shed blood.
> <a name="20:1:17">1:17</a> Surely it is futile to spread a net
> in view of any bird,
> <a name="20:1:18">1:18</a> but these men lie in wait for their own blood,
> they ambush their own lives!
> <a name="20:1:19">1:19</a> Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly;
> it takes away the life of those who obtain it.

### Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom

> <a name="20:1:20">1:20</a> Wisdom calls out in the street,
> she shouts loudly in the plazas;
> <a name="20:1:21">1:21</a> at the head of the noisy streets she calls,
> in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
> <a name="20:1:22">1:22</a> “How long will you simpletons love naiveté?
> How long will mockers delight in mockery
> and fools hate knowledge?
> <a name="20:1:23">1:23</a> If only you will respond to my rebuke,
> then I will pour out my thoughts to you
> and I will make my words known to you.
> <a name="20:1:24">1:24</a> However, because I called but you refused to listen,
> because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,
> <a name="20:1:25">1:25</a> because you neglected all my advice,
> and did not comply with my rebuke,
> <a name="20:1:26">1:26</a> so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,
> I will mock when what you dread comes,
> <a name="20:1:27">1:27</a> when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,
> and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,
> when distressing trouble comes on you.
> <a name="20:1:28">1:28</a> Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;
> they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
> <a name="20:1:29">1:29</a> Because they hated moral knowledge,
> and did not choose to fear the Lord,
> <a name="20:1:30">1:30</a> they did not comply with my advice,
> they spurned all my rebuke.
> <a name="20:1:31">1:31</a> Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,
> and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
> <a name="20:1:32">1:32</a> For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them,
> and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
> <a name="20:1:33">1:33</a> But the one who listens to me will live in security,
> and will be at ease from the dread of harm.

## Chapter 2

### Benefits of Seeking Wisdom

> <a name="20:2:1">2:1</a> My child, if you receive my words,
> and store up my commands within you,
> <a name="20:2:2">2:2</a> by making your ear attentive to wisdom,
> and by turning your heart to understanding,
> <a name="20:2:3">2:3</a> indeed, if you call out for understanding,
> and raise your voice for understanding,
> <a name="20:2:4">2:4</a> if you seek it like silver,
> and search for it like hidden treasure,
> <a name="20:2:5">2:5</a> then you will understand how to fear the Lord,
> and you will discover knowledge about God.
> <a name="20:2:6">2:6</a> For the Lord gives wisdom,
> and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
> <a name="20:2:7">2:7</a> He stores up effective counsel for the upright,
> and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,
> <a name="20:2:8">2:8</a> to guard the paths of the righteous
> and to protect the way of his pious ones.
> <a name="20:2:9">2:9</a> Then you will understand righteousness and justice
> and equity—every good way.
> <a name="20:2:10">2:10</a> For wisdom will enter your heart,
> and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.
> <a name="20:2:11">2:11</a> Discretion will protect you,
> understanding will guard you,
> <a name="20:2:12">2:12</a> to deliver you from the way of the wicked,
> from those speaking perversity,
> <a name="20:2:13">2:13</a> who leave the upright paths
> to walk on the dark ways,
> <a name="20:2:14">2:14</a> who delight in doing evil,
> they rejoice in perverse evil;
> <a name="20:2:15">2:15</a> whose paths are morally crooked,
> and who are devious in their ways;
> <a name="20:2:16">2:16</a> to deliver you from the adulteress,
> from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;
> <a name="20:2:17">2:17</a> who leaves the husband from her youth,
> and forgets her marriage covenant made before God.
> <a name="20:2:18">2:18</a> For her house sinks down to death,
> and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.
> <a name="20:2:19">2:19</a> None who go in to her will return,
> nor will they reach the paths of life.
> <a name="20:2:20">2:20</a> So you will walk in the way of good people,
> and will keep on the paths of the righteous.
> <a name="20:2:21">2:21</a> For the upright will reside in the land,
> and those with integrity will remain in it,
> <a name="20:2:22">2:22</a> but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
> and the treacherous will be torn away from it.

### Exhortations to Seek Wisdom and Walk with the Lord

> <a name="20:3:1">3:1</a> My child, do not forget my teaching,
> but let your heart keep my commandments,
> <a name="20:3:2">3:2</a> for they will provide a long and full life,
> and they will add well-being to you.
> <a name="20:3:3">3:3</a> Do not let truth and mercy leave you;
> bind them around your neck,
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <a name="20:3:4">3:4</a> Then you will find favor and good understanding,
> in the sight of God and people.
> <a name="20:3:5">3:5</a> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
> and do not rely on your own understanding.
> <a name="20:3:6">3:6</a> Acknowledge him in all your ways,
> and he will make your paths straight.
> <a name="20:3:7">3:7</a> Do not be wise in your own estimation;
> fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
> <a name="20:3:8">3:8</a> This will bring healing to your body,
> and refreshment to your inner self.
> <a name="20:3:9">3:9</a> Honor the Lord from your wealth
> and from the first fruits of all your crops;
> <a name="20:3:10">3:10</a> then your barns will be filled completely,
> and your vats will overflow with new wine.
> <a name="20:3:11">3:11</a> My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord,
> and do not loathe his rebuke.
> <a name="20:3:12">3:12</a> For the Lord disciplines those he loves,
> just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.

### Blessings of Obtaining Wisdom

> <a name="20:3:13">3:13</a> Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
> and the one who obtains understanding.
> <a name="20:3:14">3:14</a> For her benefit is more profitable than silver,
> and her gain is better than gold.
> <a name="20:3:15">3:15</a> She is more precious than rubies,
> and none of the things you desire can compare with her.
> <a name="20:3:16">3:16</a> Long life is in her right hand;
> in her left hand are riches and honor.
> <a name="20:3:17">3:17</a> Her ways are very pleasant,
> and all her paths are peaceful.
> <a name="20:3:18">3:18</a> She is like a tree of life to those who obtain her,
> and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed.
> <a name="20:3:19">3:19</a> The Lord by wisdom laid the foundation of the earth;
> he established the heavens by understanding.
> <a name="20:3:20">3:20</a> By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open,
> and the clouds drip down dew.
> <a name="20:3:21">3:21</a> My child, do not let them escape from your sight;
> safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
> <a name="20:3:22">3:22</a> So they will give life to you,
> and grace to adorn your neck.
> <a name="20:3:23">3:23</a> Then you will walk on your way with security,
> and you will not stumble.
> <a name="20:3:24">3:24</a> When you lie down you will not be filled with fear,
> and when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
> <a name="20:3:25">3:25</a> You will not be afraid of sudden disaster,
> or when destruction comes on the wicked;
> <a name="20:3:26">3:26</a> for the Lord will be the source of your confidence,
> and he will guard your foot from being ensnared.

### Wisdom Demonstrated in Relationships with People

> <a name="20:3:27">3:27</a> Do not withhold good from those who need it,
> when you have the ability to do it.
> <a name="20:3:28">3:28</a> Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow
> and I will give it”—when you have it with you at the time.
> <a name="20:3:29">3:29</a> Do not plot evil against your neighbor
> when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.
> <a name="20:3:30">3:30</a> Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause,
> if he has not treated you wrongly.
> <a name="20:3:31">3:31</a> Do not envy a violent man,
> and do not choose any of his ways;
> <a name="20:3:32">3:32</a> for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord,
> but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.
> <a name="20:3:33">3:33</a> The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,
> but he blesses the home of the righteous.
> <a name="20:3:34">3:34</a> Although he is scornful to arrogant scoffers,
> yet he shows favor to the humble.
> <a name="20:3:35">3:35</a> The wise inherit honor,
> but he holds fools up to public contempt.

### Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness

> <a name="20:4:1">4:1</a> Listen, children, to a father’s instruction,
> and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.
> <a name="20:4:2">4:2</a> Because I give you good instruction,
> do not forsake my teaching.
> <a name="20:4:3">4:3</a> When I was a son to my father,
> a tender only child before my mother,
> <a name="20:4:4">4:4</a> he taught me, and he said to me:
> “Let your heart lay hold of my words;
> keep my commands so that you will live.
> <a name="20:4:5">4:5</a> Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;
> do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <a name="20:4:6">4:6</a> Do not forsake her, and she will protect you;
> love her, and she will guard you.
> <a name="20:4:7">4:7</a> Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom,
> and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!
> <a name="20:4:8">4:8</a> Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;
> she will honor you if you embrace her.
> <a name="20:4:9">4:9</a> She will place a fair garland on your head;
> she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”
> <a name="20:4:10">4:10</a> Listen, my child, and accept my words,
> so that the years of your life will be many.
> <a name="20:4:11">4:11</a> I will guide you in the way of wisdom
> and I will lead you in upright paths.
> <a name="20:4:12">4:12</a> When you walk, your steps will not be hampered,
> and when you run, you will not stumble.
> <a name="20:4:13">4:13</a> Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
> protect it, because it is your life.
> <a name="20:4:14">4:14</a> Do not enter the path of the wicked
> or walk in the way of those who are evil.
> <a name="20:4:15">4:15</a> Avoid it, do not go on it;
> turn away from it, and go on.
> <a name="20:4:16">4:16</a> For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;
> they are robbed of sleep until they make someone fall.
> <a name="20:4:17">4:17</a> For they eat bread gained from wickedness
> and drink wine obtained from violence.
> <a name="20:4:18">4:18</a> But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,
> growing brighter and brighter until full day.
> <a name="20:4:19">4:19</a> The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;
> they do not know what causes them to stumble.
> <a name="20:4:20">4:20</a> My child, pay attention to my words;
> listen attentively to my sayings.
> <a name="20:4:21">4:21</a> Do not let them depart from your sight,
> guard them within your heart;
> <a name="20:4:22">4:22</a> for they are life to those who find them
> and healing to one’s entire body.
> <a name="20:4:23">4:23</a> Guard your heart with all vigilance,
> for from it are the sources of life.
> <a name="20:4:24">4:24</a> Remove perverse speech from your mouth;
> keep devious talk far from your lips.
> <a name="20:4:25">4:25</a> Let your eyes look directly in front of you
> and let your gaze look straight before you.
> <a name="20:4:26">4:26</a> Make the path for your feet level,
> so that all your ways may be established.
> <a name="20:4:27">4:27</a> Do not turn to the right or to the left;
> turn yourself away from evil.

### Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil

> <a name="20:5:1">5:1</a> My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
> pay close attention to my understanding,
> <a name="20:5:2">5:2</a> in order to safeguard discretion,
> and that your lips may guard knowledge.
> <a name="20:5:3">5:3</a> For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
> and her seductive words are smoother than oil,
> <a name="20:5:4">5:4</a> but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
> sharp as a two-edged sword.
> <a name="20:5:5">5:5</a> Her feet go down to death;
> her steps lead straight to the grave.
> <a name="20:5:6">5:6</a> Lest she should make level the path leading to life,
> her paths are unstable but she does not know it.
> <a name="20:5:7">5:7</a> So now, children, listen to me;
> do not turn aside from the words I speak.
> <a name="20:5:8">5:8</a> Keep yourself far from her,
> and do not go near the door of her house,
> <a name="20:5:9">5:9</a> lest you give your vigor to others
> and your years to a cruel person,
> <a name="20:5:10">5:10</a> lest strangers devour your strength,
> and your labor benefit another man’s house.
> <a name="20:5:11">5:11</a> And at the end of your life you will groan
> when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
> <a name="20:5:12">5:12</a> And you will say, “How I hated discipline!
> My heart spurned reproof!
> <a name="20:5:13">5:13</a> For I did not obey my teachers
> and I did not heed my instructors.
> <a name="20:5:14">5:14</a> I almost came to complete ruin
> in the midst of the whole congregation!”
> <a name="20:5:15">5:15</a> Drink water from your own cistern
> and running water from your own well.
> <a name="20:5:16">5:16</a> Should your springs be dispersed outside,
> your streams of water in the wide plazas?
> <a name="20:5:17">5:17</a> Let them be for yourself alone,
> and not for strangers with you.
> <a name="20:5:18">5:18</a> May your fountain be blessed,
> and may you rejoice in your young wife—
> <a name="20:5:19">5:19</a> a loving doe, a graceful deer;
> may her breasts satisfy you at all times,
> may you be captivated by her love always.
> <a name="20:5:20">5:20</a> But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,
> and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
> <a name="20:5:21">5:21</a> For the ways of a person are in front of the eyes of the Lord,
> and the Lord weighs all that person’s paths.
> <a name="20:5:22">5:22</a> The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,
> and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
> <a name="20:5:23">5:23</a> He will die because there was no discipline;
> because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.

### Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

> <a name="20:6:1">6:1</a> My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,
> and have become a guarantor for a stranger,
> <a name="20:6:2">6:2</a> if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,
> and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
> <a name="20:6:3">6:3</a> then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
> because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
> go, humble yourself,
> and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
> <a name="20:6:4">6:4</a> Do not give sleep to your eyes
> or slumber to your eyelids.
> <a name="20:6:5">6:5</a> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,
> and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
> <a name="20:6:6">6:6</a> Go to the ant, you sluggard;
> observe its ways and be wise!
> <a name="20:6:7">6:7</a> It has no commander,
> overseer, or ruler,
> <a name="20:6:8">6:8</a> yet it prepares its food in the summer;
> it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.
> <a name="20:6:9">6:9</a> How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
> When will you rise from your sleep?
> <a name="20:6:10">6:10</a> A little sleep, a little slumber,
> a little folding of the hands to relax,
> <a name="20:6:11">6:11</a> and your poverty will come like a robber,
> and your need like an armed man.
> <a name="20:6:12">6:12</a> A worthless and wicked person
> walks around saying perverse things;
> <a name="20:6:13">6:13</a> he winks with his eyes,
> signals with his feet,
> and points with his fingers;
> <a name="20:6:14">6:14</a> he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,
> he spreads contention at all times.
> <a name="20:6:15">6:15</a> Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;
> in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
> <a name="20:6:16">6:16</a> There are six things that the Lord hates,
> even seven things that are an abomination to him:
> <a name="20:6:17">6:17</a> haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
> and hands that shed innocent blood,
> <a name="20:6:18">6:18</a> a heart that devises wicked plans,
> feet that are swift to run to evil,
> <a name="20:6:19">6:19</a> a false witness who pours out lies,
> and a person who spreads discord among family members.
> <a name="20:6:20">6:20</a> My child, guard the commands of your father
> and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
> <a name="20:6:21">6:21</a> Bind them on your heart continually;
> fasten them around your neck.
> <a name="20:6:22">6:22</a> When you walk about, they will guide you;
> when you lie down, they will watch over you;
> when you wake up, they will talk to you.
> <a name="20:6:23">6:23</a> For the commandments are like a lamp,
> instruction is like a light,
> and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
> <a name="20:6:24">6:24</a> by keeping you from the evil woman,
> from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
> <a name="20:6:25">6:25</a> Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,
> and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
> <a name="20:6:26">6:26</a> for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,
> but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
> <a name="20:6:27">6:27</a> Can a man hold fire against his chest
> without burning his clothes?
> <a name="20:6:28">6:28</a> Can a man walk on hot coals
> without scorching his feet?
> <a name="20:6:29">6:29</a> So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor’s wife;
> no one who touches her will escape punishment.
> <a name="20:6:30">6:30</a> People do not despise a thief when he steals
> to fulfill his need when he is hungry.
> <a name="20:6:31">6:31</a> Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,
> he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
> <a name="20:6:32">6:32</a> A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom,
> whoever does it destroys his own life.
> <a name="20:6:33">6:33</a> He will be beaten and despised,
> and his reproach will not be wiped away;
> <a name="20:6:34">6:34</a> for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,
> and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
> <a name="20:6:35">6:35</a> He will not consider any compensation;
> he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.

### Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress

> <a name="20:7:1">7:1</a> My child, keep my words
> and treasure up my commands within your own keeping.
> <a name="20:7:2">7:2</a> Keep my commands so that you may live,
> and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
> <a name="20:7:3">7:3</a> Bind them on your forearm;
> write them on the tablet of your heart.
> <a name="20:7:4">7:4</a> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
> and call understanding a close relative,
> <a name="20:7:5">7:5</a> so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,
> from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.
> <a name="20:7:6">7:6</a> For at the window of my house
> through my window-lattice I looked out
> <a name="20:7:7">7:7</a> and I saw among the naive,
> I discerned among the youths,
> a young man who lacked wisdom.
> <a name="20:7:8">7:8</a> He was passing by the street near her corner,

## Chapter 25

### Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah

> <a name="20:25:1">25:1</a> These also are proverbs of Solomon,
> which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:
> <a name="20:25:2">25:2</a> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
> and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
> <a name="20:25:3">25:3</a> As the heaven is high and the earth deep
> so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
> <a name="20:25:4">25:4</a> Remove the dross from the silver,
> and material for the silversmith will emerge;
> <a name="20:25:5">25:5</a> remove the wicked from before the king,
> and his throne will be established in righteousness.
> <a name="20:25:6">25:6</a> Do not honor yourself before the king,
> and do not stand in the place of great men;
> <a name="20:25:7">25:7</a> for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
> than to put you lower before a prince,
> whom your eyes have seen.
> <a name="20:25:8">25:8</a> Do not go out hastily to litigation,
> or what will you do after it
> when your neighbor puts you to shame?
> <a name="20:25:9">25:9</a> When you argue a case with your neighbor,
> do not reveal the secret of another person,
> <a name="20:25:10">25:10</a> lest the one who hears it put you to shame
> and your infamy will never go away.
> <a name="20:25:11">25:11</a> Like apples of gold in settings of silver,
> so is a word skillfully spoken.
> <a name="20:25:12">25:12</a> Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,
> so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.
> <a name="20:25:13">25:13</a> Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
> so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
> for he refreshes the heart of his masters.
> <a name="20:25:14">25:14</a> Like clouded skies and wind without rain,
> so is the one who boasts of a gift not given.
> <a name="20:25:15">25:15</a> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
> and a soft tongue can break a bone.
> <a name="20:25:16">25:16</a> When you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you,
> lest you should become filled with it and vomit it up.
> <a name="20:25:17">25:17</a> Make your foot rare in your neighbor’s house,
> lest he become weary of you and hate you.
> <a name="20:25:18">25:18</a> Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,
> so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.
> <a name="20:25:19">25:19</a> Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,
> so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.
> <a name="20:25:20">25:20</a> Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
> or like vinegar poured in soda,
> so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
> <a name="20:25:21">25:21</a> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
> and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
> <a name="20:25:22">25:22</a> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
> and the Lord will reward you.
> <a name="20:25:23">25:23</a> The north wind brings forth rain,
> and a sly tongue brings forth an angry look.
> <a name="20:25:24">25:24</a> It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
> than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
> <a name="20:25:25">25:25</a> Like cold water to a weary person,
> so is good news from a distant land.
> <a name="20:25:26">25:26</a> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
> so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.
> <a name="20:25:27">25:27</a> It is not good to eat too much honey,
> nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.
> <a name="20:25:28">25:28</a> Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,
> so is a person who cannot control his temper.

## Chapter 26

> <a name="20:26:1">26:1</a> Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
> so honor is not fitting for a fool.
> <a name="20:26:2">26:2</a> Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,
> so a causeless curse does not come to rest.
> <a name="20:26:3">26:3</a> A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,
> and a rod for the backs of fools!
> <a name="20:26:4">26:4</a> Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
> lest you yourself also be like him.
> <a name="20:26:5">26:5</a> Answer a fool according to his folly,
> lest he be wise in his own estimation.
> <a name="20:26:6">26:6</a> Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,
> so is sending a message in the hand of a fool.
> <a name="20:26:7">26:7</a> Like legs that hang limp from the lame,
> so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
> <a name="20:26:8">26:8</a> Like tying a stone in a sling,
> so is giving honor to a fool.
> <a name="20:26:9">26:9</a> Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
> so is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
> <a name="20:26:10">26:10</a> Like an archer who wounds at random,
> so is the one who hires a fool or hires any passer-by.
> <a name="20:26:11">26:11</a> Like a dog that returns to its vomit,
> so a fool repeats his folly.
> <a name="20:26:12">26:12</a> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
> There is more hope for a fool than for him.
> <a name="20:26:13">26:13</a> The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
> A lion in the streets!”
> <a name="20:26:14">26:14</a> Like a door that turns on its hinges,
> so a sluggard turns on his bed.
> <a name="20:26:15">26:15</a> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
> he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
> <a name="20:26:16">26:16</a> The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation
> than seven people who respond with good sense.
> <a name="20:26:17">26:17</a> Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,
> so is the person passing by who becomes furious over a quarrel not his own.
> <a name="20:26:18">26:18</a> Like a madman who shoots
> firebrands and deadly arrows,
> <a name="20:26:19">26:19</a> so is a person who deceives his neighbor,
> and says, “Was I not only joking?”
> <a name="20:26:20">26:20</a> Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,
> and where there is no gossip, contention dies down.
> <a name="20:26:21">26:21</a> Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
> so is a contentious person to kindle strife.
> <a name="20:26:22">26:22</a> The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;
> they go down into a person’s innermost being.
> <a name="20:26:23">26:23</a> Like a coating of glaze over earthenware
> are fervent lips with an evil heart.
> <a name="20:26:24">26:24</a> The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,
> but he keeps deceit within him.
> <a name="20:26:25">26:25</a> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
> for there are seven abominations within him.
> <a name="20:26:26">26:26</a> Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,
> his evil will be uncovered in the assembly.
> <a name="20:26:27">26:27</a> The one who digs a pit will fall into it;
> the one who rolls a stone—it will come back on him.
> <a name="20:26:28">26:28</a> A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,
> and a flattering mouth works ruin.

## Chapter 27

> <a name="20:27:1">27:1</a> Do not boast about tomorrow;
> for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
> <a name="20:27:2">27:2</a> Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
> someone else, and not your own lips.
> <a name="20:27:3">27:3</a> A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
> but vexation by a fool more burdensome than the two of them.
> <a name="20:27:4">27:4</a> Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
> but who can stand before jealousy?
> <a name="20:27:5">27:5</a> Better is open rebuke
> than hidden love.
> <a name="20:27:6">27:6</a> Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
> but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
> <a name="20:27:7">27:7</a> The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,
> but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.
> <a name="20:27:8">27:8</a> Like a bird that wanders from its nest,
> so is a person who wanders from his place.
> <a name="20:27:9">27:9</a> Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,
> likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.
> <a name="20:27:10">27:10</a> Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father,
> and do not enter the house of your brother in the day of your disaster;
> a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.
> <a name="20:27:11">27:11</a> Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad,
> so that I may answer anyone who taunts me.
> <a name="20:27:12">27:12</a> A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,
> but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.
> <a name="20:27:13">27:13</a> Take his garment that is security for a stranger
> and hold him in pledge that is surety for strangers.
> <a name="20:27:14">27:14</a> If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
> it will be counted as a curse to him.
> <a name="20:27:15">27:15</a> A continual dripping on a rainy day
> and a contentious wife are alike.
> <a name="20:27:16">27:16</a> Whoever hides her hides the wind

> <a name="20:27:17">27:17</a> As iron sharpens iron,

> <a name="20:27:18">27:18</a> The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,

> <a name="20:27:19">27:19</a> As in water the face is reflected as a face,
> so a person’s heart reflects the person.
> <a name="20:27:20">27:20</a> As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,
> so the eyes of a person are never satisfied.
> <a name="20:27:21">27:21</a> As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
> so a person is proved by the praise he receives.
> <a name="20:27:22">27:22</a> If you should pound the fool in the mortar

> his foolishness would not depart from him.
> <a name="20:27:23">27:23</a> Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,

> <a name="20:27:24">27:24</a> for riches do not last forever,
> nor does a crown last from generation to generation.
> <a name="20:27:25">27:25</a> When the hay is removed and new grass appears,

> <a name="20:27:27">27:27</a> And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,

## Chapter 28

> <a name="20:28:1">28:1</a> The wicked person flees when there is no one pursuing,

> <a name="20:28:3">28:3</a> A poor person who oppresses the weak

## Chapter 29

### The Words of Agur

> <a name="20:30:1">30:1</a> The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle;
> This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
> <a name="20:30:2">30:2</a> Surely I am more brutish than any other man,

> four things that move about magnificently:
> <a name="20:30:30">30:30</a> a lion, mightiest of the beasts,
> who does not retreat from anything;
> <a name="20:30:31">30:31</a> a strutting rooster, a male goat,
> and a king with his army around him.
> <a name="20:30:32">30:32</a> If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself
> or if you have planned evil,
> put your hand over your mouth!
> <a name="20:30:33">30:33</a> For as the churning of milk produces butter
> and as punching the nose produces blood,
> so stirring up anger produces strife.

### The Words of Lemuel

> <a name="20:31:1">31:1</a> The words of King Lemuel,
> an oracle that his mother taught him:
> <a name="20:31:2">31:2</a> O my son, O son of my womb,
> O son of my vows,
> <a name="20:31:3">31:3</a> Do not give your strength to women,
> nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
> <a name="20:31:4">31:4</a> It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
> it is not for kings to drink wine,
> or for rulers to crave strong drink,
> <a name="20:31:5">31:5</a> lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
> and remove from all the poor their rights.
> <a name="20:31:6">31:6</a> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
> and wine to those who are distressed;
> <a name="20:31:7">31:7</a> let them drink and forget their poverty,
> and remember their misery no more.
> <a name="20:31:8">31:8</a> Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
> for the legal rights of all the dying.
> <a name="20:31:9">31:9</a> Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
> and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
> The Wife of Noble Character
> <a name="20:31:10">31:10</a> Who can find a wife of noble character?
> For her value is far more than rubies.
> <a name="20:31:11">31:11</a> The heart of her husband has confidence in her,
> and he has no lack of gain.
> <a name="20:31:12">31:12</a> She brings him good and not evil
> all the days of her life.
> <a name="20:31:13">31:13</a> She obtains wool and flax,
> and she is pleased to work with her hands.
> <a name="20:31:14">31:14</a> She is like the merchant ships;
> she brings her food from afar.
> <a name="20:31:15">31:15</a> She also gets up while it is still night,
> and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
> <a name="20:31:16">31:16</a> She considers a field and buys it;
> from her own income she plants a vineyard.
> <a name="20:31:17">31:17</a> She begins her work vigorously,
> and she strengthens her arms.
> <a name="20:31:18">31:18</a> She knows that her merchandise is good,
> and her lamp does not go out in the night.
> <a name="20:31:19">31:19</a> Her hands take hold of the distaff,
> and her hands grasp the spindle.
> <a name="20:31:20">31:20</a> She extends her hand to the poor,
> and reaches out her hand to the needy.
> <a name="20:31:21">31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
> for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.
> <a name="20:31:22">31:22</a> She makes for herself coverlets;
> her clothing is fine linen and purple.
> <a name="20:31:23">31:23</a> Her husband is well-known in the city gate
> when he sits with the elders of the land.
> <a name="20:31:24">31:24</a> She makes linen garments and sells them,
> and supplies the merchants with sashes.
> <a name="20:31:25">31:25</a> She is clothed with strength and honor,
> and she can laugh at the time to come.
> <a name="20:31:26">31:26</a> She opens her mouth with wisdom,
> and loving instruction is on her tongue.
> <a name="20:31:27">31:27</a> She watches over the ways of her household,
> and does not eat the bread of idleness.
> <a name="20:31:28">31:28</a> Her children rise up and call her blessed,
> her husband also praises her:
> <a name="20:31:29">31:29</a> “Many daughters have done valiantly,
> but you surpass them all.”
> <a name="20:31:30">31:30</a> Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,
> but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.
> <a name="20:31:31">31:31</a> Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
> and let her works praise her in the city gates.
