# Ecclesiastes

## Chapter 1

<a name="21:1:1">1:1</a> The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:

### Introduction: Utter Futility

> <a name="21:1:2">1:2</a> “Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher,
> “Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”

### Futility Illustrated from Nature

> <a name="21:1:3">1:3</a> What benefit do people get from all the effort
> which they expend on earth?
> <a name="21:1:4">1:4</a> A generation comes and a generation goes,
> but the earth remains the same through the ages.
> <a name="21:1:5">1:5</a> The sun rises and the sun sets,
> it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.
> <a name="21:1:6">1:6</a> The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north,
> round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.
> <a name="21:1:7">1:7</a> All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,
> and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.
> <a name="21:1:8">1:8</a> All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it:
> The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.
> <a name="21:1:9">1:9</a> What exists now is what will be,
> and what has been done is what will be done;
> there is nothing truly new on earth.
> <a name="21:1:10">1:10</a> Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new!”?
> It was already done long ago, before our time.
> <a name="21:1:11">1:11</a> No one remembers the former events,
> nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;
> they will not be remembered by the future generations.
> Futility of Secular Accomplishment
> <a name="21:1:12">1:12</a> I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
> <a name="21:1:13">1:13</a> I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine
> all that has been accomplished on earth.
> I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task
> that keeps them occupied.
> <a name="21:1:14">1:14</a> I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,
> and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile—like chasing the wind!
> <a name="21:1:15">1:15</a> What is bent cannot be straightened,
> and what is missing cannot be supplied.

### Futility of Secular Wisdom

> <a name="21:1:16">1:16</a> I thought to myself,
> “I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;
> I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”
> <a name="21:1:17">1:17</a> So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;
> however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind!
> <a name="21:1:18">1:18</a> For with great wisdom comes great frustration;
> whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.

## Chapter 2

### Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure

> <a name="21:2:1">2:1</a> I thought to myself,
> “Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”
> But I found that it also is futile.
> <a name="21:2:2">2:2</a> I said of partying, “It is folly,”
> and of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”
> <a name="21:2:3">2:3</a> I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine—
> the whole time my mind was guiding me with wisdom—
> and the effects of behaving foolishly,
> so that I might discover what is profitable
> for people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.

### Futility of Materialism

> <a name="21:2:4">2:4</a> I increased my possessions:
> I built houses for myself;
> I planted vineyards for myself.
> <a name="21:2:5">2:5</a> I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,
> and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
> <a name="21:2:6">2:6</a> I constructed pools of water for myself,
> to irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.
> <a name="21:2:7">2:7</a> I purchased male and female slaves,
> and I owned slaves who were born in my house;
> I also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—
> than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
> <a name="21:2:8">2:8</a> I also amassed silver and gold for myself,
> as well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.
> I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,
> as well as what gives man sensual delight—a harem of beautiful concubines.
> <a name="21:2:9">2:9</a> So I was more wealthy than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,
> yet I maintained my objectivity:
> <a name="21:2:10">2:10</a> I did not hold myself back from getting whatever I wanted,
> I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.
> So all my accomplishments gave me joy,
> this was my reward for all my effort.
> <a name="21:2:11">2:11</a> Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished
> and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,
> I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless—
> like chasing the wind!
> There is nothing gained from them on earth.”

### Wisdom is Better than Folly

> <a name="21:2:12">2:12</a> Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.
> For what more can the king’s successor do, except what he has already done?
> <a name="21:2:13">2:13</a> I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,
> just as light is preferable to darkness:
> <a name="21:2:14">2:14</a> The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.
> Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.
> <a name="21:2:15">2:15</a> So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!
> Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”
> So I lamented to myself,
> “The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”
> <a name="21:2:16">2:16</a> For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,
> because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.
> Alas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!
> <a name="21:2:17">2:17</a> So I loathed life because what happens on earth seems awful to me;
> for all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.

### Futility of Being A Workaholic

> <a name="21:2:18">2:18</a> So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,
> for which I worked so hard on earth,
> because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.
> <a name="21:2:19">2:19</a> Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?
> Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor
> for which I worked so wisely on earth!
> This also is futile!
> <a name="21:2:20">2:20</a> So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor
> for which I worked so hard on earth.
> <a name="21:2:21">2:21</a> For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;
> however, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance
> to someone else who did not work for it.
> This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
> Painful Days and Restless Nights
> <a name="21:2:22">2:22</a> What does a man acquire from all his labor
> and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
> <a name="21:2:23">2:23</a> For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,
> and even at night his mind cannot relax!
> This also is futile!

### Enjoy Work and its Benefits

> <a name="21:2:24">2:24</a> There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,
> and to find enjoyment in their work.
> I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.
> <a name="21:2:25">2:25</a> For no one can eat and drink
> or experience joy apart from him.
> <a name="21:2:26">2:26</a> For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,
> but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth—
> only to give it to the one who pleases God.
> This task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!

## Chapter 3

### A Time for All Events in Life

> <a name="21:3:1">3:1</a> For everything there is an appointed time,
> and an appropriate time for every activity on earth:
> <a name="21:3:2">3:2</a> A time to be born, and a time to die;
> a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
> <a name="21:3:3">3:3</a> A time to kill, and a time to heal;
> a time to break down, and a time to build up;
> <a name="21:3:4">3:4</a> A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
> a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
> <a name="21:3:5">3:5</a> A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;
> a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
> <a name="21:3:6">3:6</a> A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;
> a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
> <a name="21:3:7">3:7</a> A time to rip, and a time to sew;
> a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
> <a name="21:3:8">3:8</a> A time to love, and a time to hate;
> a time for war, and a time for peace.
> Man is Ignorant of God’s Timing
> <a name="21:3:9">3:9</a> What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?
> <a name="21:3:10">3:10</a> I have observed the burden
> that God has given to people to keep them occupied.
> <a name="21:3:11">3:11</a> God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,
> but he has also placed ignorance in the human heart
> so that people cannot discover what God has ordained,
> from the beginning to the end of their lives.

### Enjoy Life in the Present

> <a name="21:3:12">3:12</a> I have concluded that there is nothing better for people
> than to be happy and to enjoy themselves as long as they live,
> <a name="21:3:13">3:13</a> and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,
> for it is a gift from God.

### God’s Sovereignty

> <a name="21:3:14">3:14</a> I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;
> nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.
> God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
> <a name="21:3:15">3:15</a> Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;
> for God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.

### The Problem of Injustice and Oppression

> <a name="21:3:16">3:16</a> I saw something else on earth:
> In the place of justice, there was wickedness,
> and in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.
> <a name="21:3:17">3:17</a> I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;
> for there is an appropriate time for every activity,
> and there is a time of judgment for every deed.
> <a name="21:3:18">3:18</a> I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,
> so God can clearly show them that they are like animals.
> <a name="21:3:19">3:19</a> For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:
> As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.
> There is no advantage for humans over animals,
> for both are fleeting.
> <a name="21:3:20">3:20</a> Both go to the same place,
> both come from the dust,
> and both return to dust.
> <a name="21:3:21">3:21</a> Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,
> and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?
> <a name="21:3:22">3:22</a> So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,
> because that is their reward;
> for who can show him what the future holds?

## Chapter 4

### Evil Oppression on Earth

> <a name="21:4:1">4:1</a> So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth.
> This is what I saw:
> The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them;
> no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.
> <a name="21:4:2">4:2</a> So I considered those who are dead and gone
> more fortunate than those who are still alive.
> <a name="21:4:3">4:3</a> But better than both is the one who has not been born
> and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.

### Labor Motivated by Envy

> <a name="21:4:4">4:4</a> Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:
> Surely it is nothing more than competition between one man and another.
> This also is profitless—like chasing the wind.
> <a name="21:4:5">4:5</a> The fool folds his hands and does no work,
> so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.
> <a name="21:4:6">4:6</a> Better is one handful with some rest
> than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.

### Labor Motivated by Greed

> <a name="21:4:7">4:7</a> So I again considered another futile thing on earth:
> <a name="21:4:8">4:8</a> A man who is all alone with no companion,
> he has no children nor siblings;
> yet there is no end to all his toil,
> and he is never satisfied with riches.
> He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?”
> This also is futile and burdensome task!

### Labor is Beneficial When Its Rewards Are Shared

> <a name="21:4:9">4:9</a> Two people are better than one,
> because they can reap more benefit from their labor.
> <a name="21:4:10">4:10</a> For if they fall, one will lift up his companion,
> but pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.
> <a name="21:4:11">4:11</a> Furthermore, if two lie together, they can keep each other warm,
> but how can one person keep warm by himself?
> <a name="21:4:12">4:12</a> Although an assailant may overpower one person,
> two can withstand him.
> Moreover, a three-strand cord is not quickly broken.

### Labor Motivated by Prestige-Seeking

> <a name="21:4:13">4:13</a> A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king
> who no longer knows how to receive advice.
> <a name="21:4:14">4:14</a> For he came out of prison to become king,
> even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.
> <a name="21:4:15">4:15</a> I considered all the living who walk on earth,
> as well as the second one who would arise in his place.
> <a name="21:4:16">4:16</a> There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations,
> yet future generations will not rejoice in him.
> This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.

## Chapter 5

### Rash Vows

> <a name="21:5:1">5:1</a> Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God;
> draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools,
> for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.
> <a name="21:5:2">5:2</a> Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,
> for God is in heaven and you are on earth!
> Therefore, let your words be few.
> <a name="21:5:3">5:3</a> Just as dreams come when there are many cares,
> so the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.
> <a name="21:5:4">5:4</a> When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it.
> For God takes no pleasure in fools:
> Pay what you vow!
> <a name="21:5:5">5:5</a> It is better for you not to vow
> than to vow and not pay it.
> <a name="21:5:6">5:6</a> Do not let your mouth cause you to sin,
> and do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!”
> Why make God angry at you
> so that he would destroy the work of your hands?”
> <a name="21:5:7">5:7</a> Just as there is futility in many dreams,
> so also in many words.
> Therefore, fear God!

### Government Corruption

> <a name="21:5:8">5:8</a> If you see the extortion of the poor,
> or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government,
> do not be astonished by the matter.
> For the high official is watched by a higher official,
> and there are higher ones over them!
> <a name="21:5:9">5:9</a> The produce of the land is seized by all of them,
> even the king is served by the fields.

### Covetousness

> <a name="21:5:10">5:10</a> The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money,
> he who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income.
> This also is futile.
> <a name="21:5:11">5:11</a> When someone’s prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase;
> so what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?
> <a name="21:5:12">5:12</a> The sleep of the laborer is pleasant—whether he eats little or much—
> but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.

### Materialism Thwarts Enjoyment of Life

> <a name="21:5:13">5:13</a> Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen:
> Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.
> <a name="21:5:14">5:14</a> Then that wealth was lost through bad luck;
> although he fathered a son, he does not have anything left to give him.
> <a name="21:5:15">5:15</a> Just as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked will he return as he came,
> and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.
> <a name="21:5:16">5:16</a> This is another misfortune:
> Just as he came, so will he go.
> What did he gain from toiling for the wind?
> <a name="21:5:17">5:17</a> Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life,
> and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.

### Enjoy the Fruit of Your Labor

> <a name="21:5:18">5:18</a> I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people:
> to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth
> during the few days of their life which God has given them,
> for this is their reward.
> <a name="21:5:19">5:19</a> To every man to whom God has given wealth, and possessions,
> he has also given him the ability
> to eat from them, to receive his reward and to find enjoyment in his toil;
> this is the gift of God.
> <a name="21:5:20">5:20</a> For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life
> because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.

## Chapter 6

### Not Everyone Enjoys Life

> <a name="21:6:1">6:1</a> Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth,
> and it weighs heavily on people:
> <a name="21:6:2">6:2</a> God gives a man riches, property, and wealth
> so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires,
> yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor—
> instead, someone else enjoys it!
> This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
> <a name="21:6:3">6:3</a> Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years—
> even if he lives long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity—
> even if he were to live forever—
> I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than him!”
> <a name="21:6:4">6:4</a> Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,
> though its name is shrouded in darkness,
> <a name="21:6:5">6:5</a> though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything,
> yet it has more rest than that man—
> <a name="21:6:6">6:6</a> if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.
> For both of them die!
> <a name="21:6:7">6:7</a> All of man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach—
> yet his appetite is never satisfied!
> <a name="21:6:8">6:8</a> So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool?
> And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?
> <a name="21:6:9">6:9</a> It is better to be content with what the eyes can see
> than for one’s heart to always crave more.
> This continual longing is futile—like chasing the wind.

### The Futile Way Life Works

> <a name="21:6:10">6:10</a> Whatever has happened was foreordained,
> and what happens to man was also foreknown.
> It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate
> because God is more powerful than he is.
> <a name="21:6:11">6:11</a> The more man argues with words, the less he accomplishes.
> How does that benefit him?
> <a name="21:6:12">6:12</a> For no one knows what is best for a man during his life—
> during the few days of his fleeting life—
> for they pass away like a shadow.
> Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.

## Chapter 7

### Life is Brief and Death is Certain!

> <a name="21:7:1">7:1</a> A good reputation is better than precious perfume;
> likewise, the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
> <a name="21:7:2">7:2</a> It is better to go to a funeral
> than a feast.
> For death is the destiny of every person,
> and the living should take this to heart.
> <a name="21:7:3">7:3</a> Sorrow is better than laughter,
> because sober reflection is good for the heart.
> <a name="21:7:4">7:4</a> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
> but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.

### Frivolous Living Versus Wisdom

> <a name="21:7:5">7:5</a> It is better for a man to receive a rebuke from wise men
> than to listen to the song of fools.
> <a name="21:7:6">7:6</a> For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot,
> so is the laughter of the fool.
> This kind of folly also is useless.

### Human Wisdom Overturned by Adversity

> <a name="21:7:7">7:7</a> Surely oppression can turn a wise man into a fool;
> likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.
> <a name="21:7:8">7:8</a> The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
> likewise, patience is better than pride.
> <a name="21:7:9">7:9</a> Do not let yourself become quickly provoked,
> for anger resides in the lap of fools.
> <a name="21:7:10">7:10</a> Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?”
> for it is not wise to ask that.

### Wisdom Can Lengthen One’s Life

> <a name="21:7:11">7:11</a> Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing;
> it benefits those who see the light of day.
> <a name="21:7:12">7:12</a> For wisdom provides protection,
> just as money provides protection.
> But the advantage of knowledge is this:
> Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.

### Wisdom Acknowledges God’s Orchestration of Life

> <a name="21:7:13">7:13</a> Consider the work of God:
> For who can make straight what he has bent?
> <a name="21:7:14">7:14</a> In times of prosperity be joyful,
> but in times of adversity consider this:
> God has made one as well as the other,
> so that no one can discover what the future holds.

### Exceptions to the Law of Retribution

> <a name="21:7:15">7:15</a> During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things:
> Sometimes a righteous man dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness,
> and sometimes a wicked man lives long in spite of his evil deeds.
> <a name="21:7:16">7:16</a> So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise;
> otherwise you might be disappointed.
> <a name="21:7:17">7:17</a> Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;
> otherwise you might die before your time.
> <a name="21:7:18">7:18</a> It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning;
> for the one who fears God will follow both warnings.

### Wisdom Needed Because No One is Truly Righteous

> <a name="21:7:19">7:19</a> Wisdom gives a wise man more protection
> than ten rulers in a city.
> <a name="21:7:20">7:20</a> For there is not one truly righteous man on the earth
> who continually does good and never sins.
> <a name="21:7:21">7:21</a> Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say;
> otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.
> <a name="21:7:22">7:22</a> For you know in your own heart
> that you also have cursed others many times.

### Human Wisdom is Limited

> <a name="21:7:23">7:23</a> I have examined all this by wisdom;
> I said, “I am determined to comprehend this”—but it was beyond my grasp.
> <a name="21:7:24">7:24</a> Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding;
> it is far deeper than man can fathom.

### True Righteousness and Wisdom are Virtually Nonexistent

> <a name="21:7:25">7:25</a> I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend
> the role of wisdom in the scheme of things,
> and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.
> <a name="21:7:26">7:26</a> I discovered this:
> More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter’s snare;
> her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.
> The man who pleases God escapes her,
> but the sinner is captured by her.
> <a name="21:7:27">7:27</a> The Teacher says:
> I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.
> <a name="21:7:28">7:28</a> What I have continually sought, I have not found;
> I have found only one upright man among a thousand,
> but I have not found one upright woman among all of them.
> <a name="21:7:29">7:29</a> This alone have I discovered: God made mankind upright,
> but they have sought many evil schemes.

## Chapter 8

### Human Government Demonstrates Limitations of Wisdom

> <a name="21:8:1">8:1</a> Who is a wise man? Who knows the solution to a problem?
> A man’s wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.
> <a name="21:8:2">8:2</a> Obey the king’s command,
> because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.
> <a name="21:8:3">8:3</a> Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste—do not delay when the matter is unpleasant,
> for he can do whatever he pleases.
> <a name="21:8:4">8:4</a> Surely the king’s authority is absolute;
> no one can say to him, “What are you doing?”
> <a name="21:8:5">8:5</a> Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm,
> and a wise man knows the proper time and procedure.
> <a name="21:8:6">8:6</a> For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
> for the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.
> <a name="21:8:7">8:7</a> Surely no one knows the future,
> and no one can tell another person what will happen.
> <a name="21:8:8">8:8</a> Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it,
> so no one has power over the day of his death.
> Just as no one can be discharged during the battle,
> so wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.
> <a name="21:8:9">8:9</a> While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this:
> Sometimes one man dominates other men to their harm.

### Contradictions to the Law of Retribution

> <a name="21:8:10">8:10</a> Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple,
> and as they left the holy temple, they boasted in the city that they had done so.
> This also is an enigma.
> <a name="21:8:11">8:11</a> When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime,
> the human heart is encouraged to do evil.
> <a name="21:8:12">8:12</a> Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time,
> yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people—for they stand in fear before him.
> <a name="21:8:13">8:13</a> But it will not go well with the wicked,
> nor will they prolong their days like a shadow,
> because they do not stand in fear before God.
> <a name="21:8:14">8:14</a> Here is another enigma that occurs on earth:
> Sometimes there are righteous men who get what the wicked deserve,
> and sometimes there are wicked men who get what the righteous deserve.
> I said, “This also is an enigma.”

### Enjoy Life In Spite of Its Injustices

> <a name="21:8:15">8:15</a> So I recommend the enjoyment of life,
> for there is nothing better on earth for man to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life.
> So joy will accompany him in his toil
> during the days of his life which God gives him on earth.

### Limitations of Human Wisdom

> <a name="21:8:16">8:16</a> When I tried to gain wisdom
> and to observe the activity on earth—
> even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night—
> <a name="21:8:17">8:17</a> then I discerned all that God has done:
> No one really comprehends what happens on earth.
> Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it.
> Even if a wise man claimed that he understood,
> he would not really comprehend it.

## Chapter 9

### Everyone Will Die

> <a name="21:9:1">9:1</a> So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up.
> I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God;
> whether he will be loved or hated—
> no one knows what lies ahead.
> <a name="21:9:2">9:2</a> Everyone shares the same fate—
> the righteous and the wicked,
> the good and the bad,
> the ceremonially clean and unclean,
> those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
> What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner;
> what happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.
> <a name="21:9:3">9:3</a> This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth:
> the same fate awaits everyone.
> In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil,
> and there is folly in their hearts during their lives—then they die.

### Better to Be Poor but Alive than Rich but Dead

> <a name="21:9:4">9:4</a> But whoever is among the living has hope;
> a live dog is better than a dead lion.
> <a name="21:9:5">9:5</a> For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;
> they have no further reward—and even the memory of them disappears.
> <a name="21:9:6">9:6</a> What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago,
> and they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.

### Life is Brief, so its Joys Should be Cherished

> <a name="21:9:7">9:7</a> Go, eat your food with joy,
> and drink your wine with a happy heart,
> because God has already approved your works.
> <a name="21:9:8">9:8</a> Let your clothes always be white,
> and do not spare precious ointment on your head.
> <a name="21:9:9">9:9</a> Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life
> that God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days;
> for that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.
> <a name="21:9:10">9:10</a> Whatever you find to do with your hands,
> do it with all your might,
> because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave,
> the place where you will eventually go.

### Wisdom Cannot Protect against Seemingly Chance Events

> <a name="21:9:11">9:11</a> Again, I observed this on the earth:
> the race is not always won by the swiftest,
> the battle is not always won by the strongest;
> prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest,
> wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,
> nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge—
> for time and chance may overcome them all.
> <a name="21:9:12">9:12</a> Surely, no one knows his appointed time!
> Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare—
> just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.

### Most People Are Not Receptive to Wise Counsel

> <a name="21:9:13">9:13</a> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth,
> and it is a great burden to me:
> <a name="21:9:14">9:14</a> There was once a small city with a few men in it,
> and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.
> <a name="21:9:15">9:15</a> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city,
> and he could have delivered the city by his wisdom,
> but no one listened to that poor man.
> <a name="21:9:16">9:16</a> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might,
> but a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.

### Wisdom versus Fools, Sin, and Folly

> <a name="21:9:17">9:17</a> The words of the wise are heard in quiet,
> more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.
> <a name="21:9:18">9:18</a> Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
> but one sinner can destroy much that is good.

## Chapter 10

> <a name="21:10:1">10:1</a> One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give off a rancid stench,
> so a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.

### Wisdom Can Be Nullified By the Caprice of Rulers

> <a name="21:10:2">10:2</a> A wise man’s good sense protects him,
> but a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.
> <a name="21:10:3">10:3</a> Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense,
> and shows everyone what a fool he is.
> <a name="21:10:4">10:4</a> If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position,
> for a calm response can undo great offenses.
> <a name="21:10:5">10:5</a> I have seen another misfortune on the earth:
> it is an error a ruler makes.
> <a name="21:10:6">10:6</a> Fools are placed in many positions of authority,
> while wealthy men sit in lowly positions.
> <a name="21:10:7">10:7</a> I have seen servants on horseback,
> and princes walking on foot like servants.

### Wisdom is Needed to Avert Dangers in Everyday Life

> <a name="21:10:8">10:8</a> One who digs a pit may fall into it,
> and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
> <a name="21:10:9">10:9</a> One who quarries stones may be injured by them;
> one who splits logs may be endangered by them.
> <a name="21:10:10">10:10</a> If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge,
> he must exert a great deal of effort;
> so wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
> <a name="21:10:11">10:11</a> If the snake should bite before it is charmed,
> the snake charmer is in trouble.

### Words and Works of Wise Men and Fools

> <a name="21:10:12">10:12</a> The words of a wise man win him favor,
> but the words of a fool are self-destructive.
> <a name="21:10:13">10:13</a> At the beginning his words are foolish
> and at the end his talk is wicked madness,
> <a name="21:10:14">10:14</a> yet a fool keeps on babbling.
> No one knows what will happen;
> who can tell him what will happen in the future?
> <a name="21:10:15">10:15</a> The toil of a stupid fool wears him out,
> because he does not even know the way to the city.

### The Problem with Foolish Rulers

> <a name="21:10:16">10:16</a> Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish,
> and your princes feast in the morning!
> <a name="21:10:17">10:17</a> Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility,
> and your princes feast at the proper time—with self-control and not in drunkenness.
> <a name="21:10:18">10:18</a> Because of laziness the roof caves in,
> and because of idle hands the house leaks.
> <a name="21:10:19">10:19</a> Feasts are made for laughter,
> and wine makes life merry,
> but money is the answer for everything.
> <a name="21:10:20">10:20</a> Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,
> and do not curse the rich while in your bedroom;
> for a bird might report what you are thinking,
> or some winged creature might repeat your words.

## Chapter 11

### Ignorance of the Future Demands Diligence in the Present

> <a name="21:11:1">11:1</a> Send your grain overseas,
> for after many days you will get a return.
> <a name="21:11:2">11:2</a> Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments,
> for you do not know what calamity may happen on earth.
> <a name="21:11:3">11:3</a> If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,
> and whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.
> <a name="21:11:4">11:4</a> He who watches the wind will not sow,
> and he who observes the clouds will not reap.
> <a name="21:11:5">11:5</a> Just as you do not know the path of the wind,
> or how the bones form in the womb of a pregnant woman,
> so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
> <a name="21:11:6">11:6</a> Sow your seed in the morning,
> and do not stop working until the evening;
> for you do not know which activity will succeed—
> whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.

### Life Should Be Savored Because Death is Imminent

> <a name="21:11:7">11:7</a> Light is sweet,
> and it is pleasant for a person to see the sun.
> <a name="21:11:8">11:8</a> So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,
> but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many—all that is about to come is obscure.

### Enjoy Life to the Fullest under the Fear of God

> <a name="21:11:9">11:9</a> Rejoice, young man, while you are young,
> and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
> Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes,
> but know that God will judge your motives and actions.
> <a name="21:11:10">11:10</a> Banish emotional stress from your mind.
> and put away pain from your body;
> for youth and the prime of life are fleeting.

## Chapter 12

### Fear God Now Because Old Age and Death Come Quickly

> <a name="21:12:1">12:1</a> So remember your Creator in the days of your youth—
> before the difficult days come,
> and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
> <a name="21:12:2">12:2</a> before the sun and the light of the moon and the stars grow dark,
> and the clouds disappear after the rain;
> <a name="21:12:3">12:3</a> when those who keep watch over the house begin to tremble,
> and the virile men begin to stoop over,
> and the grinders begin to cease because they grow few,
> and those who look through the windows grow dim,
> <a name="21:12:4">12:4</a> and the doors along the street are shut;
> when the sound of the grinding mill grows low,
> and one is awakened by the sound of a bird,
> and all their songs grow faint,
> <a name="21:12:5">12:5</a> and they are afraid of heights and the dangers in the street;
> the almond blossoms grow white,
> and the grasshopper drags itself along,
> and the caper berry shrivels up—
> because man goes to his eternal home,
> and the mourners go about in the streets—
> <a name="21:12:6">12:6</a> before the silver cord is removed,
> or the golden bowl is broken,
> or the pitcher is shattered at the well,
> or the water wheel is broken at the cistern—
> <a name="21:12:7">12:7</a> and the dust returns to the earth as it was,
> and the life’s breath returns to God who gave it.

### Concluding Refrain: Qoheleth Restates His Thesis

> <a name="21:12:8">12:8</a> “Absolutely futile!” laments the Teacher,
> “All of these things are futile!”

### Concluding Epilogue: Qoheleth’s Advice is Wise

> <a name="21:12:9">12:9</a> Not only was the Teacher wise,
> but he also taught knowledge to the people;
> he carefully evaluated and arranged many proverbs.
> <a name="21:12:10">12:10</a> The Teacher sought to find delightful words,
> and to write accurately truthful sayings.
> <a name="21:12:11">12:11</a> The words of the sages are like prods,
> and the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;
> they are given by one shepherd.

### Concluding Exhortation: Fear God and Obey His Commands!

> <a name="21:12:12">12:12</a> Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
> There is no end to the making of many books,
> and much study is wearisome to the body.
> <a name="21:12:13">12:13</a> Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion:
> Fear God and keep his commandments,
> for this is the whole duty of man.
> <a name="21:12:14">12:14</a> For God will evaluate every deed,
> including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
